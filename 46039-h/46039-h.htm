<h2>DEDICATION</h2>


<p>To the actors in the comedies and tragedies
of real life presented in these stories,
without whose efforts and sacrifices the
stories could not have been so interesting
and true, this volume is with grateful acknowledgments
most respectfully dedicated.
As the parts played by the actors were not
rehearsed, the performances have required a
little retouching in the interest of the reader,
the author having subordinated history to
story rather than story to history.</p>

<p class="center big p2 b2">DYNAMITE STORIES</p>



<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="center big b2">SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT
EXPLOSIVES</p>


<p>An explosive material consists of a combustible
and of an oxidizing agent for
burning the combustible. Hence it
contains within its own substance the necessary
oxygen for its combustion, so that it
will burn without atmospheric air and therefore
in a confined space.</p>

<p>There are two main kinds of explosive materials&mdash;high
explosives and gunpowder.
There are also two main kinds of high explosives&mdash;dynamites
and military high explosives. Lastly there are two main kinds
of gunpowders&mdash;black, smoky gunpowder
and smokeless gunpowder.</p>

<p>Dynamite is used mostly for commercial
blasting purposes, such as blasting rock in
the construction of railways, and so forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Military high explosives are mostly employed
for submarine mines, warheads for
torpedoes, and as bursting charges for high
explosive projectiles.</p>

<p>A high explosive is consumed almost instantly
by what is called a detonative wave;
hence it is said to detonate. When gunpowder
explodes, it is not consumed by a detonative
wave, but burns from the surface,
and the more strongly it is confined, that is
to say, the higher the pressure under which
it is burned, the more rapid is its combustion.
Although the action is rapid, it is yet
much slower than is the action of detonation
of high explosives.</p>

<p>The name gunpowder is a misnomer, for
gunpowder is no longer a powder, but is
made in the form of hard and dense grains
or sticks, according to the use for which it
is intended.</p>

<p>A gunpowder is smoky when its products
of combustion are not all gaseous. Only
about forty-four per cent. of the products of
combustion of black gunpowder is gaseous.
The rest is inert solid matter, which makes
the smoke.</p>

<p>The products of combustion of smokeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
powder, however, are practically all gaseous.
Consequently, weight for weight, it is much
more powerful than black powder.</p>

<p>Black gunpowder is a mechanical mixture
of charcoal, sulphur and saltpeter, the charcoal
and sulphur being the combustible elements,
and the saltpeter the oxidizing
element or the element that supplies the
oxygen.</p>

<p>In smokeless powder the oxygen is held in
chemical union with nitrogen and hydrogen,
but the bond between the nitrogen and the
other elements is weak, so that when ignited
the other more active elements are enabled
easily to unite at the expense of the nitrogen.</p>

<p>In the combustion of all explosive materials,
great heat is generated, and the
force of the explosion is dependent upon the
volume of gases and the high temperature
to which they are raised.</p>

<p>The smokeless powder used in the United
States is made by dissolving a special kind
of guncotton or nitrocellulose in ether and
alcohol, just sufficient of the solvent being
used to gelatinate the nitrocellulose, which is
then stuffed through a forming die into rods.
The rods are cut into sections of about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
diameters long. The die, the invention of
the writer, contains seven mandrels arranged
in such wise that when the material
is forced through the die the bar is multi-perforated
with seven holes at equal distances
apart. The grains or rods of smokeless
powder are then dried for use.</p>

<p>When burned in a cannon, all of the surfaces
of the material are practically instantly
ignited by a small flash charge of black rifle
powder used for the purpose of setting fire to
the charge of smokeless powder. The combustion
in the perforations causes them to become
larger and larger until the grain is all
consumed. This form of grain tends better
to maintain the pressure behind the projectile
in its flight through the gun, and enables
the use of larger charges of powder with
lower pressures than could otherwise be employed.
In fact, it would be impossible to
use a smokeless powder made of pure nitrocellulose
in big guns without the multi-perforations.</p>

<p>In certain European countries where the
multi-perforated powder has not been
adopted, nitroglycerin is employed, combined
with the nitrocellulose, which causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the material to burn through a greater thickness
in a given time. Thus a smokeless
powder may be made without the multi-perforations,
but smokeless powders containing
nitroglycerin erode the guns and destroy
them very quickly, while guns employing
pure nitrocellulose smokeless powders last
much longer.</p>

<p>When one of our big army or navy cannon
is fired, the time which elapses from the
instant of complete ignition of the powder
charge to the instant that the projectile leaves
the muzzle of the gun is about the fiftieth or
the sixtieth of a second, and in that time the
hard and horn-like smokeless powder material
is burned through only about a sixteenth
of an inch; hence the rate of combustion
or rate of explosion of smokeless powder
in a cannon is about four inches per second,
while it has been ascertained by actual
experiments that the rate of combustion or
rate of explosion of dynamite and other high
explosives is about four miles per second,
so that the rate of consumption of smokeless
powder, as compared to that of a high
explosive, is as are four inches to four miles.</p>

<p>As the time required for the projectile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
be thrown from a twelve-inch cannon is only
about the sixtieth of a second, sixty of these
huge guns could be placed side by side and
fired by electricity one after the other, while
grandfather&#8217;s clock is making but one tick.</p>

<p>Our ideas of duration are but relative.
We have seen that the combustion in a cannon,
though very rapid to our senses, is actually
very slow indeed as compared with
the much more rapid combustion of a high
explosive; and great as is the speed of the
detonative wave, yet the speed of the earth
in its orbit is four times as great.</p>

<p>If a celestial giant with a huge dynamite
bomb the size of the earth itself were to approach
the earth in its flight through space,
and detonate the bomb immediately behind
the earth, it would take half an hour for the
bomb to explode, that is to say, it would take
half an hour, or thirty minutes, for the explosive
wave to pass through the eight thousand
miles of its diameter. As the speed of
the earth in its orbit is four times as great
as that of the explosive wave, the earth
would rush away, leaving the bomb about
thirty thousand miles behind by the time it
had completely exploded. If the interstellar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
ether were a high explosive mixture and
were to be set off by the bomb, the earth
would pass on clear around the sun, and
while coming back, about six months later,
would meet the explosive wave still going.
It would require nearly a year for such a
detonative wave to reach our sun from the
earth.</p>

<p>We have seen that if the earth were a ball
of dynamite, it would require half an hour
to explode. If the sun were a mass of dynamite
it would require about two and a half
days to explode.</p>

<p>We frequently hear the theory advanced
that planets and suns sometimes explode
from pent-up forces within them, and that
our earth might possibly blow up. Now,
the force exerted by a high explosive is dependent
entirely upon the pressure capable
of being exerted by the gases liberated by
the explosion. The pressure exerted by the
most powerful high explosives has been estimated
to be about 500,000 pounds to the
square inch. Consequently, were the whole
molten interior of the earth to be replaced
with dynamite and detonated, the explosion
that would follow would not lift the eart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>h&#8217;s
crust. The superincumbent weight of the
earth&#8217;s crust is greater than would be the
pressure exerted by the dynamite.</p>

<p>If it were possible to throw a projectile
from the earth to the nearest fixed star,
Alpha Centauri, it would take about four
years for the light of the flash to reach that
star. The sound, if it could travel through
ether, would reach there about four million
years later. The projectile, traveling more
than twice as fast as sound, would reach
there in about two million years.</p>

<p>When one of our big twelve-inch cannon is
fired, the projectile, weighing a thousand
pounds, has a muzzle energy, stated in mechanical
terms, of about 50,000 foot tons,
that is to say, its energy is equal to 50,000
tons falling from a height of one foot&mdash;energy
enough to lift two 25,000-ton battleships
to the height of a foot.</p>

<p>As the projectile weighs half a ton, the
energy is equal to that which would be developed
by dropping the projectile from a
height of more than twenty miles, making
no account of the resistance of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Dropping upon a piece of armorplate too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hard and thick for the projectile to penetrate,
the heat developed would be sufficient
to melt 750 pounds of cast iron.</p>

<p>When one of these projectiles is fired from
the gun directly against twelve-inch armorplate,
which the projectile is capable of penetrating,
the hard-tempered steel plate in
front of the projectile is fuzed or rendered
plastic from the heat generated by the
energy of the impact, and is forced like wax
from the path of the projectile.</p>

<p>There are many popular errors regarding
the action of explosive materials. One of
the most notable is the opinion that the action
of dynamite is downward, and that if a
body of high explosive be detonated on the
surface of the earth the main effect is downward.</p>

<p>The exact opposite is the truth. When a
mass of explosive is detonated, it is converted
practically instantly into a ball of incandescent
gases and vapors under very
high pressure. When confined the gases act
to disrupt their container.</p>

<p>When a large steel projectile is charged
with a high explosive, like picric acid, and
the explosive detonated, the walls of the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>jectile
are not only broken but they are also
torn, twisted and shredded, and so quick is
the action that the inner surface of the
metal is compressed and densified against
the outer metal.</p>

<p>For this reason it is easy to tell from the
character of the fragments of a projectile
whether or not a high explosive or an explosive
of inferior power was employed, that is
to say, whether or not the explosion was of
high order or of low order.</p>

<p>There is one false belief about the action
of high explosives that has been about the
hardest of any to kill, and the cost of killing
it has been very expensive. Furthermore, it
possesses more lives than the proverbial
nine-lived cat. This belief is that five hundred
pounds or so of dynamite exploded
upon a warship or upon coast fortifications
would destroy ship or fortifications, and
that a few of such large bombs of dynamite
dropped in a city would lay the city in
ruins.</p>

<p>Upon the advent of the aeroplane and the
dirigible balloon, it was confidently believed
that the aerial bomb would quickly become
the most destructive implement of warfare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
It was prophesied that should war come between
England and Germany, London would
soon be reduced to a heap of ruins by bombs
dropped from the German Zeppelins.</p>

<p>Several years before the European War
broke out, I predicted that Zeppelin bombs
would not and could not by any possibility
work very wide destruction, and events have
since vindicated my prediction. I pointed
out the fact that should a hundred Zeppelins
visit the city of London, once a day, for a
year, returning to their base without mishap,
and each Zeppelin succeed in destroying
two buildings, the destruction would just
about keep up with the growth of that city,
for they build in London sixty thousand
houses a year.</p>

<p>We all remember the destructive powers
that were predicted for the fifteen-inch
Zalinski pneumatic dynamite guns that were
mounted at Sandy Hook and at San Francisco
at enormous Government expense.
These guns were capable of throwing with
compressed air about six hundred pounds of
nitrogelatin to a distance of from a mile-and-a-half
to two miles. It was popularly
believed that one of these bombs striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
upon a huge armorclad warship would utterly
destroy it.</p>

<p>Also two of these guns were mounted in
a sort of cruiser called the <cite>Vesuvius</cite>. During
the Spanish War the <cite>Vesuvius</cite> was taken
down to Cuba, and in one action several of
the huge bombs were thrown upon the earthworks
and fortifications of the Spanish.
They succeeded merely in mussing up the
green, grassy effect. They did no material
damage, for the reason that the action of the
explosive was nearly all upward into the air.</p>

<p>When the pneumatic dynamite gun was
promulgated, it was popularly believed that
all high explosives were exceedingly sensitive,
and that it was necessary to get them
out of the gun very gently if they were to
be thrown from ordnance.</p>

<p>The writer was the first to dispel this
folly, through the invention of Maximite, a
high explosive which will stand not only the
shock of being fired from heavy guns at high
velocities, but which will also, without exploding,
stand the far greater shock of penetrating
the heaviest armorplate&mdash;armorplate
as heavy as the projectile will stand
to pass through without breaking up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>While I was working upon Maximite and
trying to get the Government to adopt it,
Congress appropriated the money for building
an eighteen-inch gun for testing a shell
invented by Louis Gathmann, which was
intended to destroy battleships by exploding
the shell on the outside of their heavy armorplate,
it being believed that if five hundred
pounds of guncotton were to be fired against
the side of an armored ship and exploded,
the whole side of the ship would be blown
in and the vessel destroyed.</p>

<p>The gun employed by Gathmann was essentially
the same type of gun as that previously
designed by me, and explained in a
lecture by me before the Royal United Service
Institution of Great Britain in 1897, and
illustrated in a book of mine published the
same year by Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, British
Government printers, except that the
bore of my gun, which was of the same
weight as that of the Gathmann gun, was
greater. With my gun, however, I proposed
to throw armor-piercing projectiles, or projectiles
capable of penetrating an object
struck and exploding inside of it. I did not
believe that a quantity of high explosive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
could be thrown in a shell and exploded on
the outside of a heavily armored ship would
destroy it, but believed it necessary that the
explosive should penetrate and explode inside
the ship, and within earthworks and
fortifications in order to destroy them.</p>

<p>Maximite was adopted by the United
States Army in 1901. It was during that
same year that the experiments were conducted
with the Gathmann shell at Sandy
Hook. I attended those experiments.</p>

<p>Two Kruppized armorplates, each eleven-and-a-half
inches thick, sixteen feet long,
and seven-and-a-half feet wide, and each
weighing 47,000 pounds, were set up, one
as a target for the Gathmann shell and
the other as a target for the regular
United States twelve-inch Army Rifle. Each
of the plates was backed by supports to represent
the same strength as though mounted
on a battleship.</p>

<p>The Gathmann shell weighed about eighteen
hundred pounds, and carried about five
hundred pounds of guncotton, while the
Government twelve-inch shell weighed a
thousand pounds and carried only twenty-three
pounds of Maximite. The Gathmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
shell had a soft nose, which collapsed on the
plate at the instant before the explosion of
the shell, so that the guncotton might explode
fairly against the side of the plate.</p>

<p>At the first shot of the Gathmann gun,
the projectile struck the plate squarely and
exploded, but the only effect upon the plate
was to leave a great yellow smudge on its
face. The plate was neither cracked nor
pushed back. Several more shots of the
Gathmann gun were fired, and although,
under the heavy pummeling, the plate was
pushed back and broken through, up and
down, it was not otherwise injured.</p>

<p>Then the Government twelve-inch gun was
fired at the other plate. The first shell contained
nineteen pounds of high explosive,
and it passed through the plate, leaving a
clean round hole, and exploded behind the
plate without breaking it. The next shell
contained twenty-three pounds of Maximite,
and the fuze was timed to go off a little
quicker. This shell exploded in the plate
when about two-thirds through, with the result
that a hole was blown in the plate as
big as a barrel, and the plate shattered into
fragments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>One would think that these tests would
suffice forever to seal the doom of the Gathmann
type of shell. Nevertheless, it matters
not what Army and Navy officers may learn
by experience, or know without experience,
Congress does not know and does not understand,
and depends far more upon think-so
than upon experience. The result is that
Government officers are often compelled, as
in the case of the Zalinski dynamite gun and
the Gathmann shell, to waste large sums of
money while they know very well beforehand
exactly what the results will be, and
that the tests will prove the devices to be abject
failures. Even after the failure of the
Gathmann shell, another shell of almost
identical conception and purpose was made
and tested under a Congressional appropriation,
to be relegated to the scrap-heap of
failures.</p>

<p>It is very fortunate that things happen to
be as they are in the cosmos and that the
action of a high explosive when exploding
against a massive body is to rebound from
that body on the line of least resistance. It
is for this reason that more damage is not
done by great explosions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the biggest explosions in the history
of gunpowder manufacture occurred at
Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, on the 9th of
March, 1911, when it was estimated that a
thousand tons of black blasting powder blew
up. Glass was broken over a very wide area.
Some glass was broken in Chicago, about
fifty miles distant.</p>

<p>But neither the walls nor the foundations
of buildings were greatly disturbed even but
a few miles from the explosion. In the village
of Pleasant Prairie, at a distance of but
two miles, although the buildings were very
much damaged the inhabitants continued to
occupy them.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of July 30, 1916, a
very large quantity, certainly several hundred
tons, of high explosive materials blew
up in New York Harbor, not far from Ellis
Island. A large quantity of shrapnel ammunition
and other ammunition went up in
the blast, their fragments raining all over
the surrounding water. There was but very
little loss of life, and the actual material
damage to buildings in Jersey City, Manhattan
and Brooklyn was astonishingly
small, except the loss from broken glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Why is it, then, that so much glass is
broken and at such long distances, while the
foundations and walls of buildings suffer but
little injury? Let me explain. When a
quantity of high explosive detonates, a wave
of atmospheric compression is sent outward
in all directions by the explosion. It is, in
fact, a huge sound wave, and moves exactly
at the speed of sound&mdash;about eleven hundred
feet per second. Of course, buildings or
other structures or objects near enough to
the explosion to be struck by the expanding
gases themselves, or by the atmosphere immediately
propelled forward by them like a
projectile, may be destroyed, but the area
over which this action occurs is so circumscribed
that no great damage is apt to result
at distances beyond a few hundred feet.</p>

<p>However, the great sound wave may travel
to a distance of many miles. Consequently,
as a result of the explosion just referred to,
about a million dollars&#8217; worth of glass was
broken in New York City alone. One would
naturally suppose that the fragments of
window glass broken in this manner would
fall inside a building, but they do not. Almost
always they fall outside into the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The reason for this is that the wave of compression,
striking a pane of glass, forces it
inward nigh to the breaking point, and then
as the wave of compression moves on, followed
by a partial vacuum, the glass, springing
outward to fill the void, breaks, and falls
into the street.</p>

<p>An interesting incident of this great explosion
was staged at Ellis Island. There
were a goodly number of immigrants on the
Island at the time, congregated from the four
corners of the earth, some of whom had come
to America to seek their fortunes in this
land of freedom-from-everything-except-freedom,
but many had come to find quiet
and security from war&#8217;s alarums. Few of
them, indeed, had ever felt the comfort of
an overcoat, but many had dreamed of some
happy day when they would sport a veritable
fur-lined overcoat.</p>

<p>When the great explosion came it sounded
like the crack of doom, and most of the immigrants
believed it to be the real thing and
proceeded with agitated precipitation to get
their souls ready for rapid transit over the
Great Divide.</p>

<p>All eyes naturally were averted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
celestial concave, aglare with the great conflagration,
when suddenly, to the confounding
amaze of all, a large flock of fur-lined
overcoats began tumbling down out of the
heavens all over the Island. It is true they
were lined merely with sheep&#8217;s fur, but even
such a garment is as much the pride of the
Northern European peasant as is the broad,
glad-colored sombrero the pride of the Mexican
peon.</p>

<p>As the Government statute books and
rules and regulations governing immigrants
contain no provision for the disposal of such
species of manna as heaven-sent overcoats,
the immigrants were the beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Great as are such explosions as that at
Pleasant Prairie and that in New York Harbor,
they are but little things indeed compared
with the explosions that sometimes accompany
volcanic eruptions. Mother Earth
is the greatest of all explosive manufacturers.</p>

<p>Water seeping down into the earth&#8217;s crust
and trapped in large quantities in the neighborhood
of volcanoes sometimes becomes
heated to high incandescence&mdash;heated until
it is no longer water or steam, but mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
oxygen and hydrogen, far above the temperature
of their dissociation&mdash;under a pressure
so great that they occupy a space no larger
than the original water; consequently the entrapped
waters exert a pressure as great as
the strongest dynamite.</p>

<p>The most notable volcanic explosion that
ever occurred in historic time was when that
old extinct volcano, Krakatoa, in the Straits
of Sunda, that had been sleeping for thousands
of years, was literally blown into the
sky by the pressure of the pent-up gases beneath
it.</p>

<p>This great eruption occurred in 1883.
More than sixty thousand persons were
killed. The captain of a tramp steamer,
who happened to be passing in the vicinity
of Krakatoa at a distance of some miles, a
short time before the explosion occurred,
saw a very strange disturbance in the sea in
the direction of the old mountain. Taking
his glass he saw a perfect Niagara of water
pouring into an enormous fissure that had
opened in the earth. He was struck with consternation
and rightly imagining that something
very serious was likely soon to happen,
he put on all steam to escape, and luck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>ily
he had reached a point which enabled him
to survive the effects of the awful blast when
it came.</p>

<p>The vast mass of water which had tumbled
into the bowels of the earth was immediately
trapped by the closing of the great
fissure down which it had poured. The
water was quickly converted by the intense
heat into a veritable high explosive, with the
result that the massive mountain was literally
blown bodily skyward, and fell in huge
fragments into the surrounding sea. The
shock was so great that it was felt clear
through the earth, and an immense tidal
wave was set going which encircled the
earth. The opposing portions of the great
wave, meeting in the lower Atlantic, flowed
up even to the coast of France. An atmospheric
wave passed around the earth
three times. It is estimated that the amount
of volcanic mud that was discharged from
the mountain during the eruption was more
than the muddy Mississippi discharges into
the Gulf of Mexico in two hundred years.</p>

<p>There was so much impalpably fine volcanic
dust blown into the upper atmosphere
that it did not entirely settle out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the air for more than two years, which period
was noted for its beautiful glowing sunsets,
due to the illumination of the fine dust suspended
in the upper air.</p>

<p>As the ax is to the woodsman, so are high
explosives to the engineer. With dynamite
he hews down the hills, fills the valleys
and tunnels the mountain-range to make a
straight and even way for the locomotive.
He cuts canals through the width of the land,
uniting rivers and seas.</p>

<p>Always in the van of civilization, there is
heard the churn of the rock-drill and the
echoing crash and roar of the dynamite
blast.</p>

<p>Also it is the huge high explosive shell
that makes way for the march of modern
armies, and high explosive mines and torpedoes
are the terror of the underseas.</p>

<p>All forms of dynamite are high explosives,
and all high explosives may fairly be called
dynamite.</p>

<p>Smokeless gunpowder is actually but a
modified form of high explosive. It is dynamite
that has been chained and tamed by the
chemist&#8217;s cunning, so that it will burn without
detonation, and thus permit the utiliza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>tion
of its awful energy to hurl shot and shell
from war&#8217;s great guns.</p>

<p>Thus it is that dynamite in its varied
forms deserves the high place with steam
and electricity as one of the great triumvirs
that have been the architects of the modern
world.</p>

<h2>THE FORGOTTEN BIT OF FULMINATE</h2>


<p>In experimenting with high explosives
and in their manufacture, a little absent-mindedness,
a very slight lack of exact
caution, a seemingly insignificant inadvertence
for a moment, may cost one a limb or
his life. The incident that cost me my left
hand is a case in point.</p>

<p>On the day preceding that accident, I had
had a gold cap put on a tooth. In consequence,
the tooth ached and kept me awake
the greater part of the night. Next morning
I rose early and went down to my factory at
Maxim, New Jersey. In order to test the
dryness of some fulminate compound I took
a little piece of it, about the size of an English
penny, broke off a small particle, placed
it on a stand outside the laboratory and,
lighting a match, touched it off.</p>

<p>Owing to my loss of sleep the night before,
my mind was not so alert as usual, and I
forgot to lay aside the remaining piece of
fulminate compound, but, instead, held it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
my left hand. A spark from the ignited
piece entered my left hand between my
fingers, igniting the piece there, with the
result that my hand was blown off to
the wrist, and the next thing I saw was the
bare end of the wristbone. My face and
clothes were bespattered with flesh and filled
with slivers of bone.... The following
day, my thumb was found on the top of a
building a couple of hundred feet away, with
a sinew attached to it, which had been pulled
out from the elbow.</p>

<p>A tourniquet was immediately tightened
around my wrist to prevent the flow of blood,
and I and two of my assistants walked half
a mile down to the railroad, where we tried
to stop an upgoing train with a red flag. But
it ran the flag down and went on, the
engineer thinking, perhaps, from our wild
gesticulations that we were highwaymen.</p>

<p>We then walked another half-mile to a
farmhouse, where a horse and wagon were
procured. Thence I was driven to Farmingdale,
four and a half miles distant, where I
had to wait two hours for the next train to
New York.</p>

<p>The only physician in the town was an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>valid,
ill with tuberculosis. I called on him
while waiting, and condoled with him, as he
was much worse off than was I.</p>

<p>On arrival in New York, I was taken in a
carriage to the elevated station at the Brooklyn
Bridge. On reaching my station at
Eighty-fourth Street, I walked four blocks,
and then up four flights of stairs to my
apartments on Eighty-second Street, where
the surgeon was awaiting me. It was now
evening, and the accident had occurred at
half-past ten o&#8217;clock in the morning. That
was a pretty hard day!</p>

<p>As I had no electric lights in the apartments,
only gas, the surgeon declared that it
would be dangerous to administer ether, and
that he must, therefore, chloroform me. He
added that there was no danger in using
chloroform, if the patient had a strong heart.
Thereupon I asked him to examine my heart,
since, if there should be the least danger of
my dying under the influence of the anesthetic,
I wanted to make my will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heart!&#8221; exclaimed the surgeon, with
emphasis. &#8220;A man who has gone through
what you have gone through today <em>hasn&#8217;t</em>
any heart!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day I dictated letters to answer
my correspondence as usual. The young
woman stenographer, who took my dictation,
remarked, with a sardonic smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too, have now become a shorthand
writer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim jest appealed to my sense of
humor.</p>

<p>On the third day I was genuinely ill and
had no wish to do business. Within ten
days, however, I was out again, attending to
my affairs.</p>

<h2>HELL SWAZEY BREAKS UP THE
DANCE</h2>


<p>About the first use of nitroglycerin in
the United States as a blasting agent
on a large scale was in the construction
of the Hoosac Tunnel in Massachusetts,
on the Boston and Albany Railroad.</p>

<p>So many accidents had occurred where the
use of nitroglycerin had been attempted,
that engineers and contractors were afraid
to employ it. Nobel, however, had discovered
that when nitroglycerin was absorbed
in infusorial earth, it was rendered much
less sensitive. This material he called
dynamite.</p>

<p>A chemist by the name of Professor Mowbray
believed that the main trouble with
nitroglycerin had been that it was not sufficiently
purified in its manufacture. He induced
the builders of the Hoosac Tunnel to
try his product. He built a laboratory on
the side of Hoosac Mountain, over the vil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>lage
of North Adams, where he produced
the stuff.</p>

<p>He put it up in tin cans, which held about
a quart. For transportation these were
carefully packed with cotton flannel between
them.</p>

<p>The method of using the dynamite was to
pour it into holes drilled in the rock, inserting
an exploder cap and fuze in the usual
manner. At that time it was popularly supposed
that if nitroglycerin or dynamite were
allowed to freeze, it became very highly sensitive
and would explode on the slightest jar.
Stories were prevalent that the sound of a
fiddle string would explode nitroglycerin
when frozen.</p>

<p>One day there came an urgent call from
the east end of the Tunnel for more nitroglycerin.
Professor Mowbray had in his
employ a care-free and fear-free fellow by
the name of Helton Swazey. When Swazey
was sober, he was the soul of good nature,
but when drunk, which was very frequently,
he was as savage as a hungry cougar. This
peculiarity earned Helton Swazey the nickname
of Hell Swazey.</p>

<p>It was a very cold winter day when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
call came, and Professor Mowbray, learning
that Hell Swazey was going over the mountain
that very evening to attend a dance,
asked him if he would not take over the
nitroglycerin with him. A hot-water bag
was placed with the nitroglycerin and all was
wrapped in a heavy blanket to protect it
from Jack Frost. The shipment was placed
in the back of Swazey&#8217;s sleigh.</p>

<p>Hell Swazey&#8217;s best girl, whom he took with
him, did not know the nature of the cargo.</p>

<p>The nine-mile ride over the mountain was
very cold. Swazey kept himself warm by
imbibitions from a flask of liquid caloric, and
to keep the young woman warm he took
the blanket and the hot-water bag from the
nitroglycerin for her comfort, leaving the
explosive to the mercy of the below-zero
weather.</p>

<p>When Swazey arrived at the dance-hall to
join in the frolic, he was in so ugly and meddlesome
a mood that he was promptly put
out of the hall, followed by his woman companion.
Swazey was mad all through. He
went to the sleigh, and taking an armful of
the cans of nitroglycerin, returned to the
hall, and opening the door proceeded to hurl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
them with all his force at the merry-makers.</p>

<p>One can struck upon the stove and glanced
across the room. Cans smashed against
wall, ceiling and floor.</p>

<p>As the frightened occupants fled through
the windows, they did as Mark Twain did
when he saw the ghost&mdash;they did not stop
to raise the windows, but they took the windows
with them. In the language of Mark,
they did not need the windows, but it was
handier to take them than it was to leave
them, and so they took them.</p>

<p>When Hell Swazey turned up for duty the
next morning, Professor Mowbray had already
heard of the escapade, but he was
filled with marveling why the nitroglycerin
had not exploded, particularly as it must
have been frozen very hard.</p>

<p>When Swazey entered the presence of the
Professor, he expected immediately to be
discharged. He was meek and crestfallen
enough, and began to excuse himself and to
apologize for his behavior.</p>

<p>To his amazement, Professor Mowbray
appeared to be very much interested and
pleased, tapping his forehead with his finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
smiling and nodding, and muttering to himself,
&#8220;Good; good; splendid!&#8221; He interrogated
Swazey carefully, to be assured that
the nitroglycerin was frozen hard, that it
had been thrown hard, that it had struck
hard, and that it had not exploded.</p>

<p>That very night there was mailed at the
North Adams Post Office an application for
a patent for freezing nitroglycerin to make
it safe to handle.</p>

<h2>THE POET&#8217;S UPLIFT</h2>


<p>Explosive factories are veritable
schools of efficiency. All work is done
under the eye of the most vigilant caution,
and the penalty for negligence is so expensive
in the destruction of life and property
that science, which is knowledge, and
proceeds from sure premises to safe conclusions,
is the sole guide. It does not do to
follow a guess. The dynamite factory is no
place for that class of persons who believe
themselves to be favorites of Providence or
of Almighty God, for dynamite plays no favorites.</p>

<p>There is probably no other class of persons
so little guided by science as are the
poets. They pride themselves on the fact
that they ignore science. They claim that
poetry is a sort of transcendental stuff, star-dusted
from the gods&#8217; abode upon only a
few persons fortunate enough to be born
with a divine afflatus, which puts them into
a fine frenzy&mdash;a condition of body and mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
partaking somewhat of the ecstaticism of
the Whirling Dervish, the spiritual clairvoyant
and the soothsayer&mdash;a holy hysteria&mdash;a
delirium-tremendous effervescence of
over-soul&mdash;in which condition they are able
actually to commandeer the co-operation of
the Deity.</p>

<p>To heighten the humbug, the poets claim,
to quote, that &#8220;<cite>poetry knows no law</cite>,&#8221; that
&#8220;<cite>it is above and beyond all law</cite>&#8221;; and
consequently that it is &#8220;<cite>the antithesis of
science</cite>,&#8221; veritably &#8220;<cite>the despair of science</cite>,&#8221;
&#8220;<cite>defying all attempts at analysis and understanding</cite>,&#8221;
and that, being an inspired product,
&#8220;<cite>poetry is the greatest achievement of
the human mind</cite>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poets would have us believe that all of
the great inventors and discoverers, scientists
and philosophers, have been far inferior
to the poets. The poets would have
us believe that all the triumphs of chemistry
and mechanics have been small compared
with the triumphs of poetry. The poets
would have us believe that the invention of
the phonograph, of the telephone, of wireless
telegraphy, the discovery of radium and
the X-ray, the discovery of gravitation, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not equal to such triumphs of the poets as
&#8220;Aurora Leigh,&#8221; &#8220;Curfew Must Not Ring
Tonight,&#8221; and &#8220;The May Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poets would have us believe that the
discovery of the spectroscope, which tells
the composition of the stars so far away that
the light by which we see them now left its
source before the building of Babylon and
the founding of the Egyptian Pyramids, is a
less wonderful product of the human mind
than is Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Skylark.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is perfectly safe for the poets to live
and move and have their being in error, but
it does not do even for a poet, when working
with explosive materials, to eliminate
scientific procedure, for in that case he is
likely to get an uplift that will sprinkle the
feet of the angels with his filamented fragments.</p>

<p>This very thing actually once happened in
the Pennsylvania oil region when the poet
laureate of his community was blessed by the
discovery of petroleum on his otherwise
worthless farm. One well sunk by the oil
company gushed a large quantity of both oil
and natural gas. The royalty received by
the poet was immense. One day he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>ceived
the idea of climbing to the top of the
oil-derrick and writing a poem to vent his
pent-up fervor.</p>

<p>He had engaged the services of a photographer
to catch his beatitudinations. The
sun was just descending the horizon, and the
poet and the top of the derrick were still
aglow in the radiance of sunset, while derrick
and poet were enveloped in an explosive
mixture of gas and air a hundred feet in
diameter. The photographer had said,
&#8220;Beady, look pleasant, please.&#8221; This was
the moment of inspiration. The poet loosed
his divine afflatus and set his fine frenzy to
doing things. The following science-confounding
doggerel is what he effused:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poetry is a divine art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am a poet to the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And am writing these lovely lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right where the setting sun shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just at the close of a beautiful day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the milk-like Milky Way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But which cannot be seen just yet though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of the sunset&#8217;s brighter glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I know it is there, and poesy may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raise me nearer the Milky Way.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>... And it did, for at this point the poet
struck a match to light a cigarette, and the
explosive mixture of natural gas and air
about him fired first.</p>

<p>When last seen the poet was headed for
the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>HOW BENDER LOWERED THE PRICE
OF DYNAMITE</h2>


<p>Once, when entering my storage magazine
at Maxim, New Jersey, in which
were several carloads of dynamite,
along with 37,000 pounds of nitrogelatin,
made to fill an order from the Brazilian Government,
I saw John Bender, one of my laboring
men, calmly but emphatically opening
a case of dynamite with cold chisel and
hammer. With some epithetitious phraseology,
I dismissed him.</p>

<p>It was not long after this incident, when
the Boniface of the inn at Farmingdale, a
nearby village, called upon me to buy some
dynamite. He told me that he had employed
John Bender to blow the stumps out of a
meadow lot. I related to him my experience
with that reckless person, and tried to impress
him with the fact that Bender was
temperamentally so constituted as to court
death, not only for himself but for others
about him, when handling dynamite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>But Boniface was unconvinced. He
wanted Bender to do the work and he wanted
the dynamite to do it with. Bender, he said,
had assured him that he was a great expert
in the handling of dynamite&mdash;that he could
so place a charge under a stump that he
could always tell beforehand the direction
the stump would take, and about how far it
would go under the impulse of the blast.
Therefore, it was only a question of the price
of the dynamite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the dynamite you want
is sixteen cents a pound, but I&#8217;ll bet you the
dynamite against the price of it that John
Bender kills himself with it, so that if he does
not succeed in blowing himself up and killing
himself with the dynamite, you can have
it for nothing. On the other hand, if he does
blow himself up, you must pay for the
dynamite.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days later, there was some hitch in
Bender&#8217;s exceptional luck. A particularly
refractory old stump had resisted a couple
of Bender&#8217;s dynamic attacks. The failure to
dislodge the stump Bender took as a personal
affront, because it reflected upon his
skill as a stump-blaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Next time,&#8221; said he, &#8220;something is going
to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed about twenty pounds of dynamite
under the deep-rooted veteran, touched
it off, and several things happened in very
quick succession. The huge stump let go its
hold on earth, and proceeded to hunt Bender.
It was a level race, but the stump won.
Striking Bender on the north quarter, it
stove in four ribs, dislocated a few joints,
and damaged him in several other respects
and particulars.</p>

<p>Boniface came to settle for the dynamite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen cents a pound,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Bender
hasn&#8217;t a chance in a hundred. Wait till
the doctors are through with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say to a compromise,&#8221; suggested
Boniface, &#8220;of eight cents a pound?
For really,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;I do not believe that
Bender is more than half dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the account was settled on that basis.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2>FOOLHARDY KRUGER</h2>


<p>One of the most dare-devil men I ever
had in my employ was a young fellow
by the name of Joe Kruger. He
was a very hard worker, and that won pardon
for his many indiscretions.</p>

<p>I sent him one day to a neighboring explosives
works to get a special kind of guncotton
made there, and told him to have it
sent by freight in a wet state. Instead, however,
he filled about fifty pounds into a big
burlap bag, in a perfectly dry state, and
took it on the train with him and into the
smoking-car, placing it on the seat beside
him. He struck a match, lighted a cigar,
and smoked throughout the entire journey.
Had the least spark of match or cigar fallen
upon the bag, the guncotton would have
gone off with a tremendous flash and, although
it would not have detonated, it would
have burned him terribly, as well as any
persons sitting near, and would have blown
out all of the windows in the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time, in order to test the insensitiveness
of a certain high explosive, a
quantity of it was charged into a four-inch
iron pipe, and the pipe hung against a tree
as a target to ascertain whether or not the
bullet would penetrate the high explosive
without exploding it.</p>

<p>Kruger and I fired several shots with a
Springfield rifle from cover at long range
without hitting the cylinder of explosive. I
was then called away and told Kruger to continue
firing until he hit the mark. As soon
as I left him, he advanced with the gun to
within a few rods of the tree. His first shot
penetrated the cylinder, exploding it with
terrific violence, blowing the tree, which was
about eight inches in diameter, clean off,
while the fragments of metal flew about his
head like hailstones. But none happened to
hit him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is the sort of adventure that
is likely to happen to anyone under similar
circumstances and has doubtless happened
before and since.</p>

<p>Kruger had a dog which was well trained
to fetch anything that his master threw for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
him. One day Kruger took some sticks of
dynamite and went to a neighboring stream
with the intention of dynamiting some fish.
He attached fuze and exploder to a stick of
the explosive, and threw it toward the
stream, but, missing his aim, the dynamite
landed on a rock.</p>

<p>The faithful dog, thinking that the stick
had been thrown for him to bring, ran and
returned with it to his master in great glee,
with the fuze sizzing nearer and nearer to
the explosive. Kruger ran in horror, the
dog after him, deeming it great sport. The
dog being the better runner, danced about his
master. Finding it impossible to escape by
running, Kruger climbed a tree with all the
alacrity he could muster, and had just
reached a vantage of safety when the dynamite
exploded, and the dog&mdash;well, the dog
was holding the stick in his mouth when it
went off.</p>

<h2>DISCHARGING PAT</h2>


<p>A works foreman of mine who had
been employed as assistant superintendent
in another dynamite factory
told me the following story:</p>

<p>He one day intercepted an Irish laborer
who was taking a barrel, which had been
used for settling nitroglycerin, down to the
soda dry-house, with the intention of filling
it with hot nitrate of soda from the drying-pans.
The foreman scolded Pat roundly,
and told him that, should he do such a reckless
thing again, he would be instantly discharged.
The foreman then went to the superintendent&#8217;s
office and reported the matter.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Patrick, utterly ignoring
the injunction, simply waited for the foreman
to disappear, then proceeded to the dry-house
with the barrel and began to fill it with
the hot nitrate of soda.</p>

<p>Over in the superintendent&#8217;s office the
foreman had just completed his narration of
Pat&#8217;s carelessness, when there was a thun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>derous
report and a crash of glass, and
Pat&#8217;s booted foot landed on the office floor
between them.</p>

<p>The superintendent dryly remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> &#8220;Evidently,
Pat is already discharged!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LINES TO A LADY</h2>


<p>Some years ago, when I was conducting
experiments with detonators for my
safety delay-action fuze, which was
adopted by the United States Navy in 1908
as the service detonating fuze for high-explosive
projectiles, I received instructions
that a parcel of fulminate detonators, made
at the torpedo station, had been received and
were being held for me at Fort Lafayette,
and I was told to go to the Brooklyn Navy
Yard, whence I would be taken in a tug to
the Fort for them.</p>

<p>After having procured the package, I concluded
that it would be much more expeditious
for me to take a trolley car home than
to return by the tug. On entering the car
and seating myself, I placed the package beside
me on the seat, keeping my eye constantly
upon it. It was, by the way, perfectly
safe to carry if subject to merely ordinary
handling, but it would not do to jump
on it or to kick it about much, for, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
case, there might be some energetic results.</p>

<p>No sooner had I comfortably seated myself
in the car than a huge, determined, militant-looking
woman entered, brushing a few
small men aside. Seeing all the seats occupied
except the space where the package was,
she turned and hurled herself backward and
downward.</p>

<p>Her movements were so quick that I had
barely time to throw my left arm firmly
under her, and, although I am unusually
strong, I had all I could do to support her
enormous bulk. When she felt my arm beneath
her, protecting the package, she was
all the more indignant and determined to
crush the package in order to teach me a lesson,
and she glared upon me fiercely. I
finally succeeded, by throwing my shoulder
against her, in toppling her sufficiently to remove
the package with my right hand, and
then I let her down upon the seat.</p>

<p>I seldom wax poetical, and never permit
myself to write verses to ladies when I am
not sure that they will be gratefully received.
But, in this case, I side-stepped a little
from my usual course, and, taking my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
note-book from my pocket, wrote the following
lines, which I folded up nicely, and when
I arrived at my street, I handed the paper
to Her Militancy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear Madam, I&#8217;m an anarchist.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That package was a bomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I&#8217;m on my way<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Someone to slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is really true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I didn&#8217;t want to waste that bomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On just the likes of you.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>



<h2>HE SEPARATED</h2>


<p>The freezing point of dynamite is about
eight degrees F. higher than that of
water. Once frozen, it remains congealed
at temperatures considerably above
the freezing point. When solidly frozen, it
can be detonated only with much difficulty,
and even then only with great loss of explosive
force. Consequently, when conducting
blasting operations in cold weather, it is
necessary to thaw frozen dynamite before
using it. The process is neither dangerous
nor difficult if conducted with ordinary precautions,
but it may be made full of peril by
carelessness or ignorance.</p>

<p>A friend of mine named Roynor, when
gold-hunting in Alaska, had as a partner a
venerable prospector whose only known
name was Andy. Andy was the dynamiter
of the combination, as well as chief cook and
dish-washer.</p>

<p>The old man used to utilize the oven of the
cooking stove for thawing his dynamite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Occasionally, he would forget that the dynamite
was there until it was heated to the
danger point. These little inadvertencies at
last strained the nerves of Roynor beyond
the elastic limit. He remonstrated to his
aged partner with all the epithetitious sesquipedalian
terminology of which he was
capable, but nothing in the way of language
or dynamite had any terrors for the old
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andy,&#8221; said Roynor, finally, &#8220;if you are
not more careful with that dynamite, we are
going to separate, and we are going to separate
the very next time you put any dynamite
in the oven.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following evening, as Roynor was returning
from his day&#8217;s work, and when nigh
the shack where his partner was cooking, he
saw the shack instantly convert itself into
a blinding flash, which solidified into numerous
scattered débris that flew by him and
fell round him in abundance.</p>

<p>When he recovered from the stunning
shock of the explosion and dazedly looked
about him, he saw many fragmentary evidences
of the repetition of the prospector&#8217;s
carelessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Andy,&#8221; he sadly remarked, &#8220;I
told you we should separate the next time
you did it. We have separated all right&mdash;particularly
you.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE WELL-DIGGER&#8217;S CASUALTIES</h2>


<p>At my laboratory near Lake Hopatcong,
one of the natives, who had made a
reputation as a well-digger, and claimed
to be able to descend through more rock in
a day than could any other living man,
thought that his strenuous habitude would
adapt him to the manufacture of explosive
materials, and with this in view he applied
to me for a position.</p>

<p>My foreman gave him a job in which his
duty was to assist with the rolling of motorite.
The foreman gave the fellow explicit
instructions about the care necessary to keep
his fingers from getting in between the rollers,
as it would not only prove uncomfortable
for him were he to shed a finger or a
hand, but it would also spoil the motorite by
mixing it with his lacerations.... Almost
at once, the end of one finger went.</p>

<p>Immediately, the well-digger was discharged,
for his own sake and for the sake
of motorite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The man next took a contract to dig a well
for one of the cottagers on the Lake. It was
in the early winter. The weather was cold,
and his dynamite froze very hard. He
placed it in a bucket of boiling hot water,
which thawed the outer stratum of the frozen
stick, overheating it and rendering it very
sensitive, while the core remained frozen
solid.</p>

<p>He was too active and impatient a workman
to wait long for a stick of dynamite to
thaw, so he took the partly thawed stick,
seized a hatchet, and proceeded to chop off
one end of it.</p>

<p>The blow of the ax upon the soft, overheated,
highly sensitive portion, compressing
it against the frozen interior, which
served as an anvil, exploded the stick.
There was one finger and the thumb left on
his right hand which held the ax, while his
left hand, which had held the dynamite, and
his whole left arm, were blown away.</p>

<p>When he looked about him with the one
astonished eye that was left, he seemed
pained that his old friend dynamite had
gone back on him in that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE RIVAL EDITORS</h2>


<p>The following story was related to me
by a professional liar, and yet I have
suspicions that it is not true in every
detail; but I feel sure that some variant of
it has been true more than once, with the exception
of the aerial incident.</p>

<p>A certain inventor had invented one of the
very often-invented high explosive compounds
of chlorate of potash, sulphur, charcoal,
paraffin wax, etc., thinking that he had
made a great discovery.</p>

<p>Now it happens that there is so much erraticism
about high explosive mixtures with
chlorate of potash as a base that the pathway
of invention of such compounds has
been strewn with the wreckage of the hopes
and anatomy of their inventors.</p>

<p>The inventor had enlisted the financial
support of a promoter, and the promoter
was endeavoring to enlist financial support
for himself, and to that end had invited several
men of means, with two rival newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
editors of the place, to witness a demonstration
of the explosive at the inventor&#8217;s laboratory,
which was a two-story, light frame
structure.</p>

<p>The promoter was letting himself be interviewed
by the two editors and other newspaper
reporters on the upper floor, while the
inventor was making a demonstration with
some of the stuff on the lower floor, the
prospective investors warily watching the
proceedings from a respectful distance.</p>

<p>The inventor had about half a barrel of
the stuff in a tub. He first took a portion
of it and pounded it on an anvil to show that
it would not explode from shock. Next he
took a handful of it and threw it into the
fire under the boiler, to show that it would
not explode from mere ignition. He then
took a hot iron, which he had brought to a
white heat in a forge, and thrust it into the
half barrel of the infernal mixture, to show
that it simply could not be exploded except
with a very powerful exploder or detonator.</p>

<p>But the mixture happened, on that occasion,
to differ somewhat from the inventor
with respect to the sequence of eventuations&mdash;and
exploded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The building went up, and the promoter,
the two editors and the reporters on the
upper floor accompanied the building.</p>

<p>Two of the newspaper men were great
rivals. One of them was the editor of the
<cite>Clarion</cite> and the other the editor of the <cite>Echo</cite>.
It so happened that the <cite>Clarion</cite> had better
facilities for getting telegraphic news than
the <cite>Echo</cite>, and accordingly the <cite>Clarion</cite> was
usually able to post its news in advance of
the <cite>Echo</cite>, and the editor of the <cite>Clarion</cite> used
often to chaff his rival with the remark,
&#8220;It&#8217;s no use to put up your poster now, for
my poster of the same news is just coming
down.&#8221; He called the <cite>Echo</cite> the echo of the
<cite>Clarion</cite>.</p>

<p>When the explosion occurred, the editor
of the <cite>Clarion</cite>, being more directly over the
explosive than was the editor of the <cite>Echo</cite>,
went up farther and faster, and on his return
met the editor of the <cite>Echo</cite> still going
up, and called out to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> &#8220;Behind as usual!
All of the other fellows are coming down.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE PASSING OF &#8220;JEOPARDY&#8221;</h2>


<p>We once had a servant girl whom we
nicknamed &#8220;Jeopardy,&#8221; because she
could not be prevented from pouring
kerosene directly from the can upon a
lighted fire.</p>

<p>One day, Jeopardy left us very suddenly,
and she never came back. We were sorry
she left, as Jeopardy was a good girl. It
developed that she had chanced to find a
fifty-pound case of dynamite sticks in the
wood-shed, which she had been using to start
the fire in the kitchen stove.</p>

<p>Sometimes, dynamite will work all right
for such a purpose, but it is notional stuff
and can not be depended upon merely to
burn. It was during one of these intervals of
independability that Jeopardy went.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE INVOLUNTARY ATTACK</h2>


<p>Soon after the invention of the Maxim
automatic machine gun, I took the
American agency for the introduction
of the weapon to the United States Government.
Among the tests that were conducted
with the gun at Sandy Hook was one known
as the sand test, sand being sifted into the
mechanism of the gun, which was then loaded
and fired. The gun went through the test
perfectly.</p>

<p>The commanding officer, however, had not
himself been present at the regular tests
and arrived upon the scene only after they
had been concluded. This particular officer
was a dyspeptic, and was at times very unpleasant
and domineering. On this occasion,
he was particularly so. When told by the
officers immediately in charge of the tests
that they had been concluded, he peremptorily
commanded that the gun should be loaded
and fired again. One of the under-officers
demurred, stating that a sand test was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
very hard one on the gun, and that it would
be unfair to subject it to unnecessary hardship
of that character. That officer was immediately
sat upon very hard.</p>

<p>The gun was loaded and made ready,
pointing out to sea, as usual. At this moment,
a schooner was seen rapidly coming
into range. The commanding officer, however,
said that he wanted to see only a few
rounds fired, and that there would be plenty
of time to fire them before the schooner
came into the zone of danger; and he immediately
gave the command: &#8220;Fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>My assistant, who was operating the gun,
instantly obeyed. After the discharge of
perhaps twenty-five rounds came the command:
&#8220;Cease firing!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the gun kept right on. Then, the command
came several times in loud shouts, but
the gun did not hear. The rage of the commanding
officer was at white heat, but it did
no good. The gun kept right on firing.</p>

<p>There were three hundred and thirty-three
rounds in the belt, the weapon had
been rigidly clamped to a set direction, and
my assistant, being a little bit rattled at the
loud shouts of the commanding officer, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not think to unclamp it, and turn it out of
range of the schooner.</p>

<p>Soon, a stream of bullets, flying at the
rate of six hundred a minute, were ricocheting
all about the schooner, and there was
wild excitement and waving of hands on
board&mdash;all to no purpose, until the last cartridge
had been exploded.</p>

<p>The trigger had been pulled by the sand
and held pulled. It was, consequently, impossible
to stop the gun from firing, until
the belt of cartridges was exhausted.</p>

<p>I felt glad. The subordinate officers also
looked gratified.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>HOIST WITH HIS OWN PETARD</h2>


<p>Liquid nitroglycerin is still used to torpedo
the oil-wells when they get old,
in order to give them a new lease
of life.</p>

<p>There was one teamster in the old days
who had become notorious as a hauler of the
dangerous explosive. The law does not permit
the shipment of the liquid by freight or
by express, and for that reason this teamster
had plenty to do in hauling nitroglycerin for
long distances. He was a great smoker and
his old pipe was always alight, though he
might be riding on a ton of nitroglycerin
with a few kegs of black gunpowder chinked
into the load.</p>

<p>One day he was carrying, on runners, about
two tons of nitroglycerin and a few odd kegs
of gunpowder, when something happened.
There had been a fall of several inches of
light snow the evening before, and the scene
of the eventuation was an open field which
he was crossing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an enormous crater in the
ground; the light snow around the crater was
besprinkled with a few shreds of horse and
harness and a sliver or two of sled, but not
a trace of the driver was ever found.</p>

<h2>THE FORGOTTEN PRECAUTION</h2>


<p>I once hired board and apartments at
the house of a Frenchwoman, who took
in only a few select gentlemen boarders.
Perhaps I may have been justly esteemed the
star boarder, inasmuch as I paid the highest
price, and, too, in addition to a sleeping
room and a library, I hired another large
room to serve me as a laboratory. Although
my main laboratory was located at my factory,
still I was in the habit of conducting
a few experiments in a small way when not
at the factory.</p>

<p>I had given my landlady particular instructions
about not handling the various
things in my laboratory. I strictly enjoined
her not to touch anything under any circumstances&mdash;I
would keep the place in order myself.
Nevertheless, she could not be prevented
from entering the laboratory to dust
and tidy it up a bit, and she generally
knocked over a thing or two in the process.</p>

<p>One day, I brought home a pint glass jar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of pure nitroglycerin, setting it up out of
reach of the little three-year-old girl, who
often used the laboratory as a playground,
in spite of my protestations. I called my
landlady&#8217;s attention to the fact that this bottle
contained nitroglycerin, and I explained
its dangerous character unless it were left
undisturbed.</p>

<p>I told her that, if she found it out of the
question to let the bottle alone, and should,
in dusting, succeed in knocking it over and
spilling its contents upon the table where it
stood or upon the floor, and should wipe up
the oily liquid with a rag, not to put the rag
in the stove, for, if she did, she would blow
the roof of the house off, and project herself
into the empyrean, and through it and out
at the other side.</p>

<p>She actually remembered this injunction
for more than three days, but, on the fourth
day, on my return home, the little three-year-old
met me as I came in, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma very sick. Cure Mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma&#8221; was lying upon a sofa, pale as
a ghost, and breathing heavily. When I
asked her what the matter was, she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
&#8220;Oh, I am so sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to be thoroughly frightened, and
wormed out of her the fact that she had a
terrible nitroglycerin headache. It came out
that she had been dusting and tidying the
laboratory that day, and had inadvertently
knocked over the bottle of nitroglycerin.
Fortunately, it did not explode as it fell, the
contents being merely spilled upon the table
and floor.</p>

<p>She took an old towel and soaked the liquid
up with it. She then rolled up the towel in
a tight, snug, compact wad, and started toward
the kitchen to put the wad in the cook-stove
and burn it up, when, just as she arrived
at the stove, she felt a dizziness in the
head, and a strange sort of sinking sensation
in the stomach. The top of her head
began to buzz and pound.</p>

<p>Then, she saw light. It dawned upon her,
like the inspiring flash that came upon Saul,
that this was nitroglycerin, and she recalled
what I had told her about the effect it would
have upon her if she handled it, and my direction
that, if she should spill the stuff and
then wipe it up, she must not burn the rag.</p>

<h2>THE FATAL HAT</h2>


<p>Out in the Pennsylvania oil regions in
the early days, while nitroglycerin in
the liquid state was being used experimentally
as a blasting agent, some boys
found in a creek an old felt hat, which had
been used as a filter for nitroglycerin.</p>

<p>One of the boys accidentally discovered
that when laid upon a stone and the edge of
the hat hit with a hammer, it would crack,
so they took it to a blacksmith&#8217;s shop, where
they could have some fun by hammering it
on an anvil.</p>

<p>At the first blow the old hat exploded.
Two of the boys were killed outright, and
two more were badly injured.</p>

<p>The blacksmith at the time of the accident,
happened to be standing outdoors, which
thereafter constituted his blacksmith shop
until he could rebuild.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2>A DROP TOO MUCH</h2>


<p>Professor Mowbray, who made
the nitroglycerin for the Hoosac Tunnel
and afterward served the American
Xylonite Company many years as consulting
chemist, conceived the idea that he could
make a very powerful smokeless gunpowder
by the use of nitroglycerin merely absorbed
by fibrous guncotton and rolled into pellets.
He had at the time a young assistant chemist
at work for him, who has now become a man
of much wealth and prominence in New
York.</p>

<p>The assistant prepared some of the pellets
under Mowbray&#8217;s directions, loaded
them into a rifle under wad and ball, and
fired at a target made of several layers of
pine boards. But the pellets did not seem
to give the bullet the required penetration.
Mowbray suggested remedying this defect
by adding a little more nitroglycerin, which
was done. The young chemist demurred a
little. Still, he did as instructed&mdash;loaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and fired the piece again, with but little better
results. This time, however, the breech
mechanism stuck, and was opened with difficulty.</p>

<p>Mowbray said that there was but one thing
to do, and that was to add a few more drops
of nitroglycerin. It occurred to the young
chemist that this sort of gunpowder came
pretty near being dynamite, and he declined
to fire the piece the next time, and was
deaf to all entreaties of the Professor. As
a compromise, the gun was rigged up on a
rest, pointing at the target; a string was attached
to the trigger, which the assistant,
standing behind a barricade, pulled.</p>

<p>This time, there was considerable penetration
of the target, and the walls of the building
where the test took place were penetrated
in many places, not with the bullet,
but with the fragments of the exploded
weapon.</p>

<p>Mowbray, hearing the report, ran out and
ventured the suggestion that he guessed he
must have got in a drop too much of nitroglycerin.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>




<h2>A CLOSE CALL</h2>


<p>I had one very close call while conducting
a sand test of the Maxim gun at
Annapolis, where the Naval Proving
Grounds were formerly located. The gun
had passed through all of the regular tests
satisfactorily, and it was then suggested to
try if sand enough could be put into the
mechanism box to block it and prevent its
firing.</p>

<p>The gun fired perhaps fifty rounds before
it stopped. Then it stuck, and my assistant
worked at the belt and lever, attempting to
start it again. I told him to put down the
safe so that the gun could not fire, which he
did. I was then about to step around the
gun in front, which I confess was a very
careless thing to do, when it began firing
again. I was already so close to the muzzle
that my clothes were cut by the bullets
and burned by the gunpowder.</p>

<p>The trigger had been pulled, and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pulled, by the sand, so that the safe did not
prevent it from firing.</p>

<p>It is pretty good practice to keep away
from the business end of a loaded gun.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>A PICKANINNY&#8217;S TREASURE TROVE</h2>


<p>Once at Annapolis, while we were firing
a six-pounder semi-automatic gun
in a speed test, we had succeeded in
firing forty-two aimed shots in a minute into
a huge earth butt, which, owing to recent
rains, was merely a heap of mud.</p>

<p>The day following, a negro boy, about
fourteen years old, found one of the projectiles,
which had penetrated the butt, and
glancing, came out at the top without exploding.
This he brought up to where my assistant
was doing some work on the gun, and
showed what he had found.</p>

<p>My assistant shouted at him, &#8220;Look out!
That&#8217;s loaded, and if you drop it, it might
go off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frightened, the negro immediately dropped
the projectile upon the hard cement pavement,
and, as it struck point down, it did go
off, and took off one of his legs; and a fragment
of the shell came dangerously close to
the head of my assistant.</p>

<h2>NOT TO BE BUNCOED</h2>


<p>The great Du Pont Powder Company
had in its employ at one time a faithful,
patient and lucky fellow, an
Italian, who worked constantly, with not a
day off except Sundays, for twenty-one years
in the corning mill, breaking black gunpowder
press cake into grains. During that
period the coming mill had blown up seven
times, once every three years, but each time
Giovanni had happened, by the merest
chance, to be outside for a few seconds to
get a drink of water or on some other brief
errand. Twice he had had his clothes nearly
ripped off him, and his face and hands
burned, such had been his proximity on these
occasions to the crater of fire as the mill
went up, and once he had been rendered unconscious
by the shock.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of twenty-one years of
service, having put aside a snug little fortune,
sufficient for the remainder of his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in sunny Italy, he packed up his belongings
and turned his face toward his old home.
Arriving in New York, his ticket purchased,
he hied himself to a noted Italian hostelry, to
await the coming of the joyous morrow when
he should actually be on the big steamer,
headed for home.</p>

<p>Giovanni had no bad habits, and the bunco
man failed to lure him. He took no stock
in the dapper, polished-mannered compatriot
just recently from his home place, who was
acquainted with all the folks. His cash was
sewed into his clothes, and those clothes
would not come off until he reached his destination.</p>

<p>When he was shown up into his room at
night and left alone with his thoughts, a
placard upon the wall above the gas-burner
attracted his attention. It read: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
blow out the gas,&#8221; and under this injunction
was the statement that gas burned after ten
o&#8217;clock would be charged extra.</p>

<p>Giovanni was indignant. Here he was at
last caught between the horns of a dilemma.
This, to his mind, was downright thievery.
He would cut the Gordian knot. He would
disobey the injunction. He would not pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for gas burned overtime perforce; and he
blew it out....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An old sea-captain who had for forty
years traveled on every sea, who had weathered
a thousand gales, and survived a hundred
shipwrecks, on his return from his final
voyage, in making his landing on his home
shore, slipped from the dock into the water
and under the skiff, and was drowned.</p>

<p>Such is the irony of chance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>SIR FREDERICK&#8217;S BONFIRE</h2>


<p>Sir Frederick Abel, who was the
originator of the modern process of
making high-grade guncotton and of
compressing it into dense cakes for use, told
me the following story:</p>

<p>At one time, Sir Frederick had about five
tons of dry guncotton, which was not of
sufficient purity to stand the Government
tests. He had, on previous occasions, frequently
demonstrated how compressed guncotton,
though dry, would quietly burn away
without exploding when ignited, so he now
fancied that his five tons would make a
capital bonfire. With this idea of entertainment
in possession of him, he invited a party
of friends to witness the unique conflagration.</p>

<p>The friends were dominated more by the
spirit of aloofness than was Sir Frederick
himself, and they kept at a respectful distance,
while Sir Frederick advanced toward
the pile of explosive, and threw a lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
torch upon it. Then he retreated a short
distance to avoid the intense heat, for he expected
to see the whole pile burn away.</p>

<p>It started by merely burning; but, as I
have already said about dynamite, it is notional
stuff. So, on this occasion, the guncotton
took a notion to explode after it got
fairly on fire, which did not take very long.
The whole mass detonated with terrific violence,
and, even before Sir Frederick had retreated
as far as he expected to go, he was
knocked senseless by the concussion, and
nearly every shred of clothing was blown
from his body.... Although considerably
bruised and lacerated, he recovered after
several months.</p>

<p>He had learned a useful lesson: that a
small quantity of compressed dry guncotton
can be very well depended upon to burn
quietly away without detonating, but, when
a large mass of it is ignited, the greater heat
of combustion and the greater pressure
generated in expelling the larger quantity of
the products of combustion, is almost sure
to produce detonation.</p>

<p>The fact that a small quantity of an explosive
material will burn away quietly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>out
exploding has often led persons to think
that a large quantity would burn in the
same manner.</p>

<p>At one time, the British Government had
on hand at Woolwich Arsenal about a hundred
tons of cordite that had begun to show
signs of decomposition, and it was decided
to burn it. The entire quantity was taken
out into an open meadow, at what was supposed
to be a very safe distance from the
city limits. A train was laid to the pile and
set on fire.</p>

<p>For the same reason that the five tons of
Sir Frederick Abel&#8217;s guncotton detonated,
this huge heap of cordite also detonated.
Almost instantly after it was ignited, it exploded
with most awful violence, and with
very disastrous results. A number of buildings
in the near vicinity were leveled to the
ground. A few persons were killed and
many more injured.</p>

<h2>THE IRREVERENT NATIVE</h2>


<p>After I had sold out my interests at
Maxim, the place was taken over by a
dynamite-manufacturing company. As
there was left in one of the magazines a considerable
quantity of dynamite when the
property changed hands, the new concern,
not choosing to sell it as their own manufacture,
proceeded to utilize it as fertilizer upon
a field of potatoes.</p>

<p>One of the natives, with his team and
helper, was engaged to do this work. They
had been instructed to use great care in
opening the cases, but they still held their
own opinions about the care necessary, which
were based largely upon the contempt that
is born of familiarity, and, having arrived
upon the potato-patch with a good, big load
of dynamite, they began to knock the cases
open in any old way.</p>

<p>There were no surviving witnesses, not
even the horses.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>AT FOLLY&#8217;S MERCY</h2>


<p>After I had sold the works at Maxim
and had invented motorite, I needed a
place in which to make the material,
and hired a branch of the works there for
that purpose.</p>

<p>It was winter. My wife had accompanied
me as a precautionary measure. She was
sitting in the laboratory to keep warm, near
a big barrel stove charged with bituminous
coal.</p>

<p>On entering the laboratory for something,
my wife asked me what was in those two tin
pails sitting near the stove. She said that
she had a suspicion it might be nitroglycerin,
and she informed me that one of my men
had just been in, stirring the fire, and that
the sparks flew out in all directions, some of
them lighting in the buckets, to be quenched
in the very thin film of water floating on top
of the oily liquid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horrors!&#8221; I said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> &#8220;It <em>is</em> nitroglycerin!&#8221;</p>

<p>I called the man who had placed it there,
and told him to take it away. As it was
necessary to keep the material from freezing,
he took it into the boiler-house near by. A
little later, on going into the boiler-house, I
saw one of the men stirring the fire, while
the other was standing with his coat-tails
outstretched in either hand, forming a shield
to keep the sparks from flying into the nitroglycerin.</p>

<p>It is practically impossible to make the
ordinary man appreciate the necessity of
care in the safe handling of explosives, and
the life of the careful man is always endangered
by the actions of the careless one.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE WATCHMAN&#8217;S DOUBLE VISION</h2>


<p>My successors in the use of the dynamite
plant at Maxim had in their employ
a day-watchman, an all-round
combination useful and useless man, his usefulness
and uselessness alternating with the
alternation of his sobriety and inebriety.</p>

<p>One morning, after a night out, he proceeded
to build the fire in the laboratory
stove. To start up the kindling wood, he
had been in the habit of lighting a handful
of shavings, and then pouring on a little
kerosene from a tomato can, which he kept
upon a near-by shelf.</p>

<p>During that night, someone&mdash;possibly one
of the laboratory operatives&mdash;had placed a
similar can, filled with nitroglycerin, upon
the same shelf, to keep it from freezing.</p>

<p>In periods of convalescence from his various
stages of intoxication, the watchman
had before seen two cans upon that shelf or
shelves, but he knew that one of them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
real, and the other an hallucination. Couldn&#8217;t
fool him that way!</p>

<p>Thinking that the hallucination would
naturally be the lighter of the two cans, he
took the one containing the nitroglycerin,
and proceeded to pour it upon the fire.</p>

<p>There was so little of him left together
after the explosion that, like Captain Castagnette,
he died of surprise at seeing himself
so dissipated.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE ZEALOUS FOOL</h2>


<p>On one occasion, at my laboratory near
the shores of Lake Hopatcong, I was
conducting some experiments to test
the efficiency of the safety chamber of a detonating
fuze for exploding projectiles
charged with Maximite. The huge loaded
shell armed with a fuze was placed in a pit
and fixed so as to be set off by electricity
from a distance.</p>

<p>To prevent any possibility of a circuit
being formed to explode the detonator while
making the connections at the pit, I went
into the machine-shop, and opened the
switch at the other end of the wires where
they were connected with the battery. Not
only did I take this precaution, but I disconnected
also the wires themselves, in order
to make assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p>Returning to the pit to connect up, my assistant,
my wife and my father-in-law accompanied
me. My assistant descended into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pit, while we stood over him, looking on.
The instant he brought the wires in contact,
the detonator went off. We looked at one
another in amazement. It takes time to get
thoroughly scared; but, as soon as we realized
the full danger through which we had
passed, we were numb with fright. Even
now, when I think of it, I have a creepy feeling.</p>

<p>We had made half a dozen tests before
this, and all of the shells had exploded except
one. This was the second in which the
safety-chamber had proved effectual. Had
it failed this time, and had the Maximite
charge exploded in the huge shell, we should
all have been blown to ribbons.</p>

<p>I rushed back to the machine-shop, where
I found that a certain employee&mdash;one of
those careful, painstaking souls who are always
attending voluntarily to the odds and
ends of work left undone by others, had discovered
the wires detached from the switch.
With no memory of the rule that the switch
should always be left open, he forthwith connected
the wires, and then, to make his
culpable industry complete, he closed the
switch, thus making the electric connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with the loaded shell; and, doubtless, he was
comforted by a sense of duty well done. His
duties in my services certainly were done,
for they ended right then and there.</p>

<h2>SOME LIVELY COTTON WASTE</h2>


<p>I once had an Italian laborer as man-of-all-work,
who was rather a good-looking
fellow. An exquisite mustache and a
wealth of curly hair were sources of great
pride and joy to him. One day he was engaged
in burning up some rubbish, and to
start a fire, took what he supposed to be a
bunch of dry cotton waste, but which was in
fact guncotton. Holding in one hand the
wad of guncotton the size of his head, he applied
a match to it. There was a quick,
bright flash, and hair and mustache had disappeared.
He did not mind the burn so
much, but his anxiety about his appearance
in the eyes of his sweetheart was pathetic.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>




<h2>SAVING TIME</h2>


<p>When I had completed at my works,
Maxim, New Jersey, a certain
frame building of generous proportions,
of which I was quite proud, and in
which I had installed various processes and
apparatus for making smokeless gunpowder,
I told one of my assistants to have a gauge
put on a large bell-drier that stood in a corner,
which was employed for the time being
to extract the moisture from about forty
pounds of guncotton. He gave instructions
to a machinist to do the job, telling him to
remove the guncotton first.</p>

<p>As it was necessary for the machinist
merely to bore a hole through the bell-drier
and screw in the connecting pipe, he thought
it a useless expenditure of time and effort to
remove the guncotton. After he had bored
the hole nearly through, he took a punch and
hammer to knock out the remaining burr.
A spark ignited the guncotton, and that bell-drier
went right up through the roof and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
turned a somersault, striking about a hundred
feet away. The walls of the building
on the end where the explosion occurred
were thrown outward, and the roof came
down.</p>

<p>My assistant and another young man were
in the building with the machinist at the
time. Although dazed by the shock, they immediately
rushed to the rescue of the poor
fellow, who lay prostrate under a pile of
burning débris. Not much could be done for
the unfortunate, and he died soon afterward.</p>

<p>This instance is a type of many that result
from inadequate precaution by workmen
in the manufacture of explosives.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE BROKEN SCALE</h2>


<p>One of the closest calls that I ever had
in my life occurred in my laboratory
at Maxim, New Jersey, in the early
nineties.</p>

<p>Two of my assistants and myself were
weighing out small batches of fulminate of
mercury from a ten-pound jar. There were
on the bench as many as half-a-dozen small
squares of glass, each with its little pile of
fulminate upon it. There was also a five-pound
bottle of nitroglycerin standing on
the bench. A little way removed, and under
the bench, was a fifty-pound can of gelatin
dynamite.</p>

<p>We were proceeding very cautiously, when
all at once the scoop toppled, and an iron
weight fell, striking within an eighth of an
inch of one of the pieces of glass on which
was fulminate of mercury. After a second
of suspense, we stared at one another in
amazement, wondering whether or not we
were still in the land of the living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>An investigation into the cause of the accident
revealed the fact that one of the young
men employed in the laboratory had broken
off an arm of the scales&mdash;one of the supports
of the scoop&mdash;the day before, and, with
criminal reticence, had made absolutely no
mention of the fact to anyone. Had that
weight fallen upon the fulminate, it must
have dealt death to all of us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE OF A
GENTLE ENGLISHMAN</h2>


<p>It so happened that during a tour of inspection
seven of us were together, going
over the works. On entering the
guncotton dry-house, I noticed a strong odor
of nitric acid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of here, quick!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;The place
is going to blow up!&#8221;</p>

<p>There were perhaps a hundred pounds of
dry guncotton in the room at the time,
spread out in pans. As was afterward
learned, the foreman, being in a hurry for
the guncotton, had turned live steam into the
pipes instead of circulating hot water
through them as instructed.</p>

<p>We were barely out of the room when the
guncotton burned with a flash, wrecking the
building and setting fire to the fragments. I
was just congratulating myself that no one
had been injured by the explosion, when it
was discovered that one of the party, an
Englishman, the even tenor of whose way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
nothing could accelerate or disturb, and who
feared nothing, had not quite made up his
mind in time to get out of the room before
the flash came. On seeing him emerge at
last from the zone of destruction, I was horror-struck,
for apparently every hair had
been burned from his head and face, while
shreds of skin hung from his hands and
cheeks and brow.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Englishman&#8217;s usual
phlegmatic manner was wholly unruffled, and
he spoke in his conventional voice, untinged
with emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Maxim, it isn&#8217;t often that one has
an opportunity under such circumstances of
witnessing exactly what occurs.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE MATCH AT THE PEEP-HOLE</h2>


<p>A certain patented device is used for
the recovery of solvents in the manufacture
of smokeless gunpowder. An
acquaintance of mine conceived the idea that
it would be an excellent thing to employ this
same device for the recovery of alcohol used
in the manufacture of felt hats. He conducted
experiments successfully, having the
hats placed in a chamber through which hot
air was circulated, and from which it was
afterwards conveyed to a refrigerating compartment
to condense out the alcohol, then
reheated and returned to the drying chamber.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this ingenious person so won
the confidence of a company of hat manufacturers
that they determined to build the apparatus
at their factory, and to give it a
thorough trial to test its practicability.
Things progressed very well indeed, until
there came a day when a leak was discovered
in some part of the apparatus, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
plumber was called in to make the necessary
repairs. This artisan&#8217;s first act was to open
a peep-hole, light a match, and peer into the
drying chamber.</p>

<p>There was much instantaneity in the activities
that followed. Fourteen persons
were killed outright, including the plumber
and his assistant, and the building was completely
wrecked.</p>

<h2>THE FLASK OF LIQUOR</h2>


<p>Some years ago, in Austria, a worker in
one of the mines found a flask nearly
full of a liquor that he took to be
whisky. Delighted with this treasure trove,
he raised the flask to his lips, and gulped
down a portion of the contents. Another
workman, standing by, snatched the flask,
and, in his turn, quaffed the liquor greedily.</p>

<p>That liquid in the flask was nitroglycerin,
which, taken internally, is one of the most
virulent of poisons. Both of these workmen
were stone dead in less time than it has taken
to tell this story of their fatal folly.</p>

<h2>IMPERTINENCE PUNISHED</h2>


<p>During the experiments at Sandy
Hook which preceded the adoption of
Maximite by the United States Government,
a young lieutenant just out of
West Point was placed in charge of the loading,
although he knew absolutely nothing
about explosives. He tried hard, however,
to make up for his deficient knowledge by
the most exacting, impertinent and foolish
requirements.</p>

<p>I rebelled, but was told by the commanding
officer that, while he fully appreciated
the situation, he must, as a matter of duty,
support his subordinate officer, and he advised
me to return to my task in looking
after the loading of the Maximite, under the
direction of the impudent youngster. This
I did.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, now having his own way,
heated some Maximite very hot and filled a
projectile with it through the false base plug
provided for the purpose. There were two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
holes in the false base plug, through one of
which the Maximite was poured into the projectile,
while the other served as a vent. Being
uncertain whether or not the projectile
was filled solidly, the officer took a round
stick, and rammed it down one of the holes,
while he looked into the other. The result
was that his eyes were filled and his face
covered with the hot liquid Maximite, putting
him out of commission for a week.</p>

<p>My sympathy for the fellow was quite
overbalanced by my gratification.</p>

<h2>CURIOSITY&#8217;S UPLIFT</h2>


<p>Shortly after the Russo-Japanese
war, there drifted in upon the Chinese
shore one of the huge floating mines
constructed by the Russians, containing
about five hundred pounds of guncotton.
This strange object greatly excited the curiosity
of the Chinese, who flocked in large
numbers to view it. While half a thousand
of them were crowded in close upon the
mine, marveling over the mystery of this
flotsam, one of their number began to investigate
it with a hammer, and, hitting the fuze
a heavy blow, exploded the mine.</p>

<p>An American witnessed the event from a
distance. Wondering what all the excitement
was about, he had started toward the
crowd with the intention of making an investigation
on his own account, when, of a
sudden, there was a flash and shock. The
horde of Chinamen that had been clustered
about the mine vanished in a cloud of dust.
Fragments of heads, arms and legs rocketed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
skyward in the form of an inverted cone.
The head of a Chinaman, severed from the
trunk, went hurtling through the air, with
the queue out-streaming behind, like a comet
coming to perihelion. It passed just over
the horrified American and struck the
ground some distance beyond him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>PROUD EVEN UNTO DEATH</h2>


<p>An inventor, who lived in the mosquito
belt of Staten Island, constructed a
dynamite gun out of a piece of four-inch-gas-pipe,
and a dynamite bomb out of
a short section of gas-pipe, capped at both
ends. The bomb was filled with No. 1 dynamite.
He placed several pads of felt between
the projectile and the powder charge,
to lessen the shock upon the bomb. By using
small charges, he succeeded in firing a
number of the projectiles safely. Although
the velocity was low, still it was greater than
that obtainable with the Zalinski pneumatic
dynamite gun, which at that time was beginning
to receive some measure of public attention.</p>

<p>The inventor was so fortunate as to have
a &#8220;pull&#8221; with the congressman from his
district, and through this influence he succeeded
in getting Government permission for
a test of his piece at Sandy Hook. In the
meantime he had strengthened the powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
chamber of his gun by driving on several
steel hoops, in order to use larger charges
of powder. So confident was he of the
safety of his system of throwing high explosives,
that, when the officers at Sandy
Hook insisted on his retiring with them behind
the bomb-proof during the firing of the
piece, he balked and insisted that he be permitted
to stand by his gun while firing it, as
he had done in his previous experiments on
Staten Island. He was not in the least impressed
with any possibility of danger by
reason of the fact that he was now using a
much larger powder charge.</p>

<p>The officers, however, were obdurate. They
told him bluntly that he must either stand
behind the bomb-proof, or his gun would not
be tested.</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, if Uncle Sam does not want
my gun enough to let me test it in my own
way, then I will sell it to foreign governments,
and make Uncle Sam feel very sick
and sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>On his return with his gun to Staten
Island, he gathered together a party of
neighbors and some representatives of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
press, to witness the experiments that Uncle
Sam had missed. When the gun was ready
to fire, the little knot of spectators frayed
out, and peeped from cover. There was but
one shot, which was not a shot, but an explosion.</p>

<p>After waiting for some time for the inventor
to come down and explain, the spectators
went home, disappointed.</p>

<h2>THE DOG THAT ATE DYNAMITE</h2>


<p>In the early nineties I was experimenting
with a new fulminate compound as a detonator
for fuzes in high explosive projectiles.
The compound consisted of fulminate
of mercury with gelatinated guncotton
and nitroglycerin.</p>

<p>One of my workmen had a pup of a miscellaneous
breed, which would eat anything
under the sun that he could masticate, and
when anything was thrown into his mouth
not too big for him to bolt, he swallowed it
without the formality of chewing it.</p>

<p>One day his master gave him about half a
pound of this fulminate compound. Another
of the workmen put some metallic sodium
and dry fulminate into a gelatin capsule,
stuck this into the end of a quintuple dynamite
cap, wrapped the whole thing in a piece
of meat, and, calling the dog out into the
field, made him stand up and &#8220;speak&#8221; for
it. Then he dropped it into the dog&#8217;s throat
and it was swallowed at a gulp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The next instant, the latter workman&#8217;s
own dog, which he prized very highly, came
upon the scene and entered into a very brisk
wrestling-bout with the dog that had been
charged. Before he could call him away,
there was a terrific explosion, and both dogs
vanished from this vale of tears.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2>INSECURE SECURITY</h2>


<p>Before the discovery by Nobel that
the absorption of nitroglycerin by infusorial
earth rendered it much less
sensitive to shock, numerous attempts were
made to bring it into general use, in liquid
form, as a blasting agent, the most notable
of which was during the digging of the
Hoosac Tunnel. But, owing to its highly
sensitive character, fatalities were numerous;
while, furthermore, the necessity for
perfect purity in order to render nitroglycerin
stable&mdash;that is to say, to make it
keep well&mdash;was not at first recognized, and
many disasters were the result from explosions
due to its decomposition.</p>

<p>The first attempt to introduce nitroglycerin
as a blasting agent into the United
States was made by a young German student.
He called the stuff &#8220;glonoin oil.&#8221; He
brought over a few hundred pounds in cans
on the steamer with him, most of which he
disposed of during his sojourn in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
States. But his venture was not a financial
success, and he was obliged, when he returned
to Europe, to leave an unpaid board
bill at a New York hotel where he had been
staying. He had left one fifty-pound can of
glonoin oil, which he let the hotel proprietor
hold as security, but which, however, later
developments proved to be insecurity.</p>

<p>The glonoin oil occupied a place of honor
in one corner of the barroom for several
months after the departure of the German
student. Decomposition having set in, yellow
nitrous fumes began to emerge from the
receptacle, the malevolent odor of which
was soon noticed by one of the guests, who
called the landlord&#8217;s attention to the fact.
Highly disgusted, the landlord picked up the
can, walked to the front door, and threw it
into the middle of the street. The act resulted
in a miniature earthquake, which shattered
the walls on both sides of the street,
broke window-glass over a square mile, and
landed the hotel proprietor in the hospital.</p>

<h2>THE LOADED CHINAMAN</h2>


<p>During the Russo-Japanese war a certain
officer of the Czar, who was an
impatient, overbearing person and a
great martinet, had a Chinese servant whom
he treated with the utmost harshness for the
smallest delinquency, or for none at all. One
of his favorite methods of inflicting punishment
for offenses was to order the Chinaman
to leave his presence, and, as the fellow
went, to give him a hard kick.</p>

<p>The Chinaman aired his grievances one
day to a Japanese spy, whom he took to be
a brother Chinaman. The Jap suggested
padding the seat of the Chinaman&#8217;s trousers
to prevent further contusions, and this was
done, the padding being furnished by the
Jap. A rubber hot-water bag was filled with
absorbent cotton containing all the nitroglycerin
it would hold. A small exploding
device armed with percussion caps was
placed in the bag so that the nitroglycerin
would be exploded by any sudden blow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
The unfortunate Chinaman was wholly unaware
of the nature of the padding.</p>

<p>At the next meeting of the Russian with
his servant, the poor Oriental inadvertently
spilled some tea upon the officer&#8217;s new uniform.
Thereupon the enraged master proceeded
to dismiss the Chinaman from his
presence in the usual way, but with somewhat
more precipitation.</p>

<p>One of the officer&#8217;s legs was blown off, one
arm was crushed to pulp, four ribs were
broken, and it was more than a day before
he was restored to consciousness. When he
did come to, he found himself a prisoner in
a Japanese hospital, having been left behind
by the retreating Russians.</p>

<p>As to the Chinaman himself, poor fellow,
he never knew that he had been loaded.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>




<h2>LIVING BOMBS</h2>


<p>An American reporter, who was with the
Japanese during the Manchurian campaign,
told me the following story:</p>

<p>Column after column of Japanese had assaulted
a Russian position, the capture of
which was exceedingly desirable. Line after
line of the brave little fellows was swept
down by the unerring gun-fire of the Russians,
but each time a few Japanese would
scale the works, and go over them, only to be
slain by the Russians inside.</p>

<p>There was a lull for a short space, and the
reporter thought, as doubtless did the Russians,
that the Japanese had given up the
task, when, suddenly, a troop of perhaps a
hundred Japanese rushed forward, in a
widely scattered line. Onward they flew toward
the Russian position, and, as they went
up, there was a blaze of the Russian rifles,
and half the Japanese column disappeared
with a flash and a tremendous report....
They had exploded!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Each of them had been loaded with an infernal
machine, hung across his breast and
over his shoulders, so that should but a few
of them reach the enemy&#8217;s position, they
could explode themselves and hurl death
and destruction all around them.</p>

<p>The Russians were so astounded, so paralyzed
by the spectacle and by the unexpectedness
of it, that they ceased firing, while the
remaining living bombs scaled the ramparts
and leaped in among their enemies, who instantly
vacated the place, flying like rats
from a sinking ship.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>




<h2>SHIPS THAT PASSED IN THE NIGHT</h2>


<p>During the Russo-Japanese conflict,
more than one of the Czar&#8217;s warships
disappeared in a night cruise
without leaving a trace.</p>

<p>I got the following story somewhat indirectly,
and for that reason cannot vouch for
its truth. It was told to my informant by a
Japanese officer while in rather a more communicative
mood than is usual for an officer
of the Mikado.</p>

<p>This Japanese official at the time commanded
a torpedo-boat. In the flotilla of
which his vessel was one there was a torpedo-boat
that carried neither guns nor torpedoes,
for she had been stripped of all
armament and every mechanical device not
absolutely essential to her navigation, in
order to lighten her. And then she was
loaded with dynamite to her full capacity.</p>

<p>The Japanese officer declared that when a
volunteer crew of half a dozen men was
called for to navigate her, ten times the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>quired
number offered themselves, although
they well knew that they were going to certain
death.</p>

<p>The flotilla was steaming slowly through
the darkness one night, not far from Port
Arthur, when there suddenly loomed up
ahead the huge bulk of a Russian warship.
At once the dynamite-laden craft threw herself
directly in front of the oncoming leviathan.</p>

<p>Without the pause of an instant, the
doomed Japanese crew sprung the huge
mine, when a vast cone of flame shot up, reddening
the night, carrying with it high into
the air, decks, superstructure and guns of
the warship. The warship&#8217;s magazines,
fired simultaneously by the dynamite blast,
aided the complete demolition. The returning
torrent of guns and wreckage plunged
into the sea.</p>

<p>All was over, and it was dark again.</p>

<h2>A WILD PROJECTILE</h2>


<p>In spite of every precaution at Government
proving grounds, big projectiles do
sometimes glance out of the butts or
heaps of earth into which they are fired, or
from the face of armorplates against which
they are directed, and finally land in most
unexpected quarters.</p>

<p>One day, while a thirteen-inch gun was being
tested at Indian Head, a projectile
glanced out of the butt, mounted high into
the air, and then came down through the roof
of a building, where there were engaged a
number of officers and book-keepers. The
projectile passed down through the floor,
close to the desk of one of the officers, and
buried itself in the earth.</p>

<p>As the projectile contained no explosive
charge, the damage was not great, but the
scare that was thrown into the occupants of
that room was of considerable magnitude.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE BOMB AND THE TRAIN</h2>


<p>One of the most anxious moments that
I ever experienced was during some
experiments made by me at Maxim in
throwing aerial torpedoes from a four-inch
cannon.</p>

<p>These torpedoes were about four feet in
length, charged with a very powerful high
explosive, and armed with a detonating fuze.
We had successfully fired several of them
into a sand-butt where they exploded with
great violence. There were six of them: five
had been fired and the sixth was loaded into
the gun, ready to be discharged, when a passenger
train on the Jersey Central Railroad
hove in sight, and was passing us about a
thousand feet away as the gun was fired.</p>

<p>We had no idea of there being any danger
to the train, as its position was well away
from the line of fire, and each of the preceding
projectiles had behaved so well. But,
this time, the torpedo glanced from the sand-butt,
and went after that train. We stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
paralyzed with dread as we saw it pass over
the train, close to the roof of a car, and
strike in the swamp just beyond it, perhaps
a couple of hundred feet behind the track.
An inverted cone of black earth shot up, followed
by a dull sound.</p>

<p>In imagination we had witnessed a frightful
catastrophe, the wreck of a passenger
train, with fearful loss of life, and all the
horror of our own resultant predicament.
Now that the danger was past, the even
tenor of our way did take on a new relish.
What objects we are, after all, of the mercy
of chance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE MISSING VESSEL</h2>


<p>At the same place, I was one day on
the point of beginning an experiment,
for which I required a small quantity
of dry guncotton. Before going for
it to the guncotton dry-house, I instituted
a search for a suitable vessel in which
to carry it. For some mysterious reason
I had much difficulty in finding anything
just adapted to my purpose, and the hunt delayed
me a matter of five minutes or more.
Finally, however, I secured a satisfactory
vessel, and hurried out of the door in the direction
of the dry-house.... I had covered
less than a rod of the distance when the
dry-house blew up.</p>

<p>In this instance, surely, a benign Providence
interfered to save me from destruction.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE DRUNKEN MESSENGER</h2>


<p>Some years ago, soon after I had built
my experimental laboratory near Lake
Hopatcong, a dear old friend came to
visit me. He had seen hard times in the interval
that had separated us, and had suffered
from both business reverses and ill
health since the days when he and I were
chums. He was plunged in the depths of
pessimism, while I was optimistic. He was
in the throes of abject discouragement.
Though I made him many offers of assistance
in varied forms, none of them seemed
to cheer him in the least.</p>

<p>When I knew him in our youth, he had
been one of the bravest men that ever lived;
now, he appeared to have lost all his former
courage. Often, however, he made the remark
that he was minded to make an end of
everything, since life offered him nothing
worth while. I frequently importuned him
against the folly of contemplating suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>It came about that one day I was in need
of fulminate of mercury. As this material
cannot be taken upon a train or sent by express,
it was necessary to go for it with
horse and wagon. Both my assistants and
myself were just then too busy to be spared
from the work in hand. So, it occurred to
me that my old friend would be exactly the
person to send on the quest. Since he was
even then engaged in meditating suicide, he
would not be in the least afraid of fetching
the stuff for me. Of course, I should not
have thought of sending him had I believed
there was any particular danger. Certainly
there would be none if the material were
handled properly, and in a wet state.</p>

<p>My old friend started on the mission
valorously enough, but he lost his courage
presently, and returned empty-handed.</p>

<p>I then sent one of my helpers, a spare man
who worked for me occasionally, as he had
been long connected with the manufacture
and handling of explosives. I gave him the
necessary money for the purchase of the material,
for the hire of the team and his other
expenses, and as there would be two or
three dollars over, I told him he could spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that in any way he liked, for his own use and
behoof.</p>

<p>He returned along toward evening, left
the horse and wagon at the stable, and
started up to the works with a bag containing
ten pounds of fulminate, placed in a
small hand-valise. Fortunately I saw him
coming soon after he had abandoned the
vehicle.</p>

<p>The road was altogether too narrow for
him; the ground seemed to reel under his
feet, and he was steadying himself by swinging
the valise back and forth from side to
side with great violence. A drunker man
never walked.</p>

<p>I took the valise away from him, and carried
it to the works myself. The next day,
when we opened it, we found that instructions
had not been followed about wetting
the fulminate. The bag of dry fulminate
had, when he procured it, been merely set in
a pail of water for a few minutes, and only
long enough to wet a thin stratum of the explosive,
leaving the whole interior perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>It is surely a wonder that the drunken
man had not exploded this mass of dry ful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>minate
in the rough handling he had given
it. Had he fallen with the bag, he must almost
certainly have caused an explosion by
the shock of the impact of the fulminate
against the ground.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>




<h2>NITROGLYCERIN BY AUTOMOBILE</h2>


<p>At another time, I required some very
pure nitroglycerin. As this material,
like the fulminate of mercury, could
not be transported by either freight or express,
it was necessary to go and bring it
over by horse and wagon, or by automobile.
I decided to go and fetch it myself with my
automobile, which, at that time, was a
Haynes-Apperson of one of the early makes.
That machine had the faculty of going wrong
oftener and in more places than any other
piece of machinery I ever saw or heard of.</p>

<p>It had a very short wheel base, and, as the
steering gear had worn so much that there
was a good deal of lost motion, it required
very great skill to keep the car in the road.
No sooner would it be brought in line with
the highway than it would immediately proceed
toward the ditch or some wall or tree.
It swayed from side to side of the road like
a drunken man, and it was necessary, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
order to keep it in the road at all, to calculate
an average with it.</p>

<p>As it was quite a long drive to where I was
to procure the nitroglycerin, I went into
New York and brought out a young chauffeur
from the Haynes-Apperson Company,
explaining to him fully why I wanted him,
and for what I was going. I made him understand
that I did not want him to start to
accompany me unless he had the courage to
stand by me to the end. He was all courage;
bravery seemed to ooze out of him at every
pore.</p>

<p>When we started on our journey, early the
next morning, I found that he was wholly unable
to steer the automobile. He could not
keep it in the road at all, and I had to drive
it all the way myself; but, as he understood
the machine and how to repair it, I concluded
that he might prove valuable on that account.
And he did, for during the outgoing and return
trip, that old machine broke down three
times, and the tires went flat four times.</p>

<p>On arrival at the factory, I let the chauffeur
wait while I went to procure the nitroglycerin.
I took a lot of bicarbonate of soda
with me, with which I absorbed the nitro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>glycerin,
forming a sort of paste. This rendered
it safe to handle, and, by placing it in
water, I could at any time dissolve out the
bicarbonate of soda, and leave the pure
nitroglycerin.</p>

<p>When I had prepared fifty pounds of nitroglycerin
in this manner, placed it in glass
jars and rolled them up with several thicknesses
of felt covering material, I had them
taken up to the automobile and placed in the
rear part of it.</p>

<p>I then told the young chauffeur that I was
ready to proceed, but he said that he had
been talking with the men in the office, and
that they had told him that they would not
ride with Mr. Maxim in that automobile with
that nitroglycerin for all the money in the
world. They had frightened the fellow
nearly out of his wits. It was with much
persuasion and reasoning and insistence that
I finally got him to consent to get into the
car with me and ride along a very smooth
even road to the skirts of the town, letting
him believe that he could there escape, and
that I would proceed alone.</p>

<p>When we got a little out of the town, I reminded
him of his agreement to stick with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
me, and told him that it would be out of the
question for me to attempt to proceed alone
without an assistant, as I had but one hand,
and could not repair the machine very well
if anything should go wrong. But he was
deaf to all entreaties.</p>

<p>Then I told him, with highly colored emphasis
and significant gestures, that, should
he not proceed with me, as he had agreed, I
might prove then and there more dangerous
to his comfort and well-being than the nitroglycerin&mdash;and
I kept him with me!</p>

<p>After having traveled a few miles, the
chauffeur began to recover his courage, and
I had no more trouble with him.</p>

<p>As I was ascending a steep grade along
a narrow road, on the return trip, I saw a
big touring car bearing down upon me, with
a party of four young men and two young
women in it. They were traveling like the
wind. I turned out of the road as far as I
possibly could, and stopped my car, and
signaled with my hand to them to slow
down, pointing to the narrowness of the
road.</p>

<p>They gave little heed to this, and rushed
by me like a tornado, coming so close that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they could not have missed my machine, hub
to hub, more than an inch.</p>

<p>There is little consolation in the fact that,
had they struck us, they never would have
known how foolish a thing they had done.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE JETS OF BLUE</h2>


<p>A chemist friend of mine once invented
a process of converting nitro-benzole
into tri-nitro-benzole by a
very quick and labor-saving method, which
consisted in mixing the nitro-benzole with
nitric acid, confining the mixture in a large,
strong, steel cylinder, then gradually heating
the cylinder until the required pressure
should be produced, which was expected to
effect the desired reaction.</p>

<p>Accordingly, five hundred pounds of nitro-benzole
was mixed with the necessary quantity
of nitric acid of the requisite strength,
and the heating process was begun.</p>

<p>While anxiously watching this infernal
machine, my friend saw a peculiar blue flame
emerge from the seam around the head.
Being of an alert nature, and able to take a
hint without being kicked by an elephant, he
withdrew from the vicinity of that cylinder.
He did not merely sidle away from the perilous
place&mdash;he fairly flew with an alacrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
born of desperation. He had barely emerged
from the laboratory when there was a terrific
explosion that leveled the building, and
formed an enormous crater in the earth
where he had stood, the concussion knocking
him senseless. And, today, he still swears,
with solemn earnestness, that a freight car
could have been buried in the hole that was
blown in the ground when his pet project
went off.</p>

<p>This experience so impressed him that he
concluded that explosive compounds possess
properties which place them in a class by
themselves, and that it is a good class to
avoid.</p>

<h2>THE WISDOM OF RETREAT</h2>


<p>During the experiments with Maximite
at Sandy Hook, previous to its
purchase and adoption by the United
States Government, I was loading some shell
in a small house, near where a ten-inch gun
was being fired. About a year or so before,
when a ten-inch gun of this particular make
was being tested at Sandy Hook, the breech
block blew out, went through the bomb-proof,
and killed several officers and men.</p>

<p>Having completed my work, I started
up the railroad track in the direction
of the steamboat landing, to return home,
when there came the ring of the bell for
another discharge of the cannon. As the
breech of the gun was pointing in my direction,
I recalled the above fatality; but I reasoned
with myself that, as a large number
of tests had since been made with these guns,
and as the defect in the breech mechanism
was supposed to have been corrected, the
chance of the breech blowing out at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
particular discharge and coming my way
was infinitely small.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I thought, it is exactly on
such occasions that the unexpected does happen.
So I ran for all I was worth up the
track and off at one side. Then I heard the
report of the gun, and looking around, saw
that sure enough the breech block had blown
out, and saw it pass through a building in
its path. I saw it strike the track over
which I had been walking, cut a rail off, saw
it strike the old stone fort beyond me, and
ricochet high into the air.</p>

<p>There was an immediate shower of stones
and débris falling around me, which I dexterously
dodged. On examining the small
house where I had been charging the Maximite
shell I found that the windows were
fairly riddled with pieces of smokeless powder,
which had been blown from the breech
of the gun.</p>

<h2>THE RACE WITH DEATH</h2>


<p>Among the many dynamite plants that
hang upon the verdant hills of the
American countryside, there is one
which stands somewhat apart from the railroad,
and the dynamite has to be carted to
the station over the highway. At one point
the highway passes close to the edge of a
precipice of considerable height, at the bottom
of whose abrupt, ragged sides nestles a
pleasant villa, owned by a wealthy business
man.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, who told me the story,
had just paid a visit to this factory of explosives,
and was walking leisurely along the
road. At a distance of perhaps a hundred
yards ahead of him there was one of the
dynamite wagons, moving two tons of dynamite
to the railroad. The driver had recently
purchased a couple of fresh horses,
which he pronounced &#8220;a spanking pair.&#8221;
They were rather restive and shied at everything
they saw. But the driver was a brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fellow and a strong one, and he had no fear
of being unable to control them.</p>

<p>All at once, under the impulse of a gust of
wind, a newspaper flared up in front of them.
Quick as a flash, they bolted, rushing headlong,
the bits held firmly between their teeth;
while the high-piled load of dynamite swayed
from side to side menacingly as the wagon
took the curves of the road.</p>

<p>At this instant the foreman of the dynamite-works
flashed by, driving a pair of
horses to an empty wagon. He had observed
the plight of the driver of the dynamite
wagon, and was lashing his horses in mad
pursuit.</p>

<p>Although the foreman&#8217;s team was inferior,
still his wagon was empty, and he was soon
neck and neck with the runaway horses. For
several hundred yards it was a close race,
neither achieving any appreciable advantage
over the other. Nearer and nearer were
they coming to the precipice, which yawned
just where the road turned sharply to the
right. Still on and on they flew, when, in a
moment of advantage, the foreman leaped
from his wagon, full upon the neck and head
of the nigh horse of the runaway pair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
brought the team to a standstill within less
than fifty feet of the precipice, and directly
over the villa I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Had not this foreman possessed both the
presence of mind and the athletic qualifications
necessary, coupled with great daring,
that load of dynamite must inevitably have
gone over the precipice as the horses struck
that curve. Little the peaceful occupants of
the villa under the hill imagined what a
calamity at that fearful moment overhung
them!</p>

<h2>THE INDOMITABLE POET</h2>


<p>An editor in a large Western mining city
once hit upon a happy expedient for
getting rid of obnoxious callers. To
this end, he filled a gunpowder keg with
ashes, inserted a fuze, piled a handful of
black gunpowder around it, to give the whole
an air of reality, and established the arrangement
on a table in his ante-room. On
the advent of certain bores, the office boy followed
instructions by lighting the fuze, and
walking out of the room with the audible
remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to blow up that old guy in
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thing proved its worth as an automatic
bouncer, until, on a memorable day, a
long-haired, calf-eyed, dreamy-looking young
male person came into the place, who informed
the office boy that he desired to see
the editor. He explained in cadenced speech
that he deigned to exhibit to the editor a
poetic effusion, the lucubration of a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
frenzy, fairly oozing divine afflatus, on the
Surplusage of Over-Soul in Young Maidens.</p>

<p>On hearing his minion&#8217;s report concerning
the visitor, the editor told the boy to light
the fuze and to ask the poet to sit down; that
the editor would see him in half an hour.</p>

<p>When the editor went out into the ante-room
the fuze had burned out, the surface
gunpowder had flashed off, but the poet was
still sitting there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>




<h2>SCATTERED</h2>


<p>I was once called as an expert to visit a
dynamite plant where a new kind of high
explosive was being manufactured instead
of the ordinary nitroglycerin dynamite.
It consisted of a mixture of chlorate
of potash, sulphur, charcoal and paraffin
wax. Its inventor had given it the reassuring
name of Double X Safety Dynamite.</p>

<p>A quarry-man in a nearby town had, with
his safety-ignoring habitude, attempted to
load a hole with the stuff, using a crowbar
as a rammer, with the result that he set off
the charge, and the crowbar went through
his head.</p>

<p>This unscheduled eventuation aroused the
apprehension of the president of the company,
who was also its backer. He began to
grow suspicious about the safety of the material.
Being so much interested, he went
with me on my visit of inspection.</p>

<p>We left the train at a siding about a mile
from the works, and had just started in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
direction when there came a sudden boom
and roar, and the earth shook. Over the
powder works there rose a huge column of
black smoke, flaring wide into the sky.</p>

<p>We found a great crater where the mixing
house had stood. Three men were working
in the building when the explosion occurred.
A fortunate survivor who had left the place
a moment before to go for a bucket of drinking
water, was walking about the crater, apparently
searching for something among the
scattered remnants. As we approached him,
he sadly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find much of the boys. I guess
you&#8217;ll have to plow the ground if you want
to bury them.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>




<h2>A LIVELY DEAD ONE</h2>


<p>Several years ago, at the works of the
American Forcite Company, a batch of
nitrogelatin blew up in process of
manufacture and several men were killed.
One laborer who was working so close to
where the explosion occurred that his clothing
was nearly all blown off and he was
spattered with the blood of his companions
and crazed by the shock, started in a wild
and aimless run along the road, with his tattered
garments flying in the wind.</p>

<p>A woman of the neighborhood, whose husband
was employed at the works, intercepted
him with the eager inquiry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anyone killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; said he, &#8220;We are all killed!
Every one of us is killed!&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was some time before he could be
convinced that he was not among the dead.</p>

<h2>INCIDENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF MOTORITE</h2>

<p>Motorite consists of a compound of
about seventy per cent. nitroglycerin
and thirty per cent. gelatinated guncotton,
the mixture being compounded in
such a way as to form a tough and rubbery
substance. This material is made into bars,
which are smoothed and varnished upon the
outside and then forced into steel tubes. In
use, these steel tubes are placed in an apparatus
in such wise that the bar of motorite
can be ignited only at the exposed end, in a
combustion chamber, into which water is
forced, and as the combustion is confined to
that end, it proceeds with absolute uniformity,
according to the pressure, and without
explosion. In other words, the motorite acts
as a fuel, the products of combustion serving
as a flame blast, blowing the water through
a series of baffle plates, atomizing it, and
converting it instantly into steam. The ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>ject
of motorite is to replace compressed air
in the driving of motors for self-propelled
torpedoes.</p>

<p>I have already expended more than fifty
thousand dollars in experiments with motorite
and on different kinds of apparatus for
its use. As about four times as much energy
is available for driving a torpedo by this
system as by any other, I hope some time to
effect arrangements for the equipment of
torpedoes with it.</p>

<p>The first bars of motorite that I made, I
formed by passing through a die. The result
was that a small, microscopic flaw which
could not be seen with the naked eye extended
through the bars from end to end,
so that, when the bar was placed in the combustion
apparatus, the flame of ignition
passed immediately down through the flaw,
exploding the apparatus.</p>

<p>After the first apparatus blew up, I
made another one, and, as I could not very
well conduct the experiments at the place
where the first mishap occurred, I hired a
floor in a building to make the test. But I
needed an assistant, and it was problematical
where I could find one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, while returning home, I was accosted
by a panhandler, a young man claiming
to have just arrived from Pittsburg,
seeking work. I told him that if he was actually
looking for work I had a job for him,
and I bade him come right along with me.
I took him home that night, fed him, and
watched him.</p>

<p>The next morning we went down to the
shop. I explained to him all about the nature
of the experiment that I was about to
try, and told him that, if he had any timidity,
the time to abscond was then and there.
He told me that he was not afraid of anything,
if I was not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I do not expect
the thing to blow up; otherwise, I would
not be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I got my time-watch ready, and told him
to press the electric button to ignite the
motorite. Instantly there was a terrific explosion.
The windows were blown out into
the street, and pieces of the shattered apparatus
were driven into the ceiling and into
the wall all about us; but fortunately neither
of us was hit.</p>

<p>John looked calmly about him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a moment, and then at me, and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;God, she busted!&#8221;</p>

<p>While we were recovering from our
amazement, half a dozen policemen rushed
into the place, accompanied by a priest. I
explained the mishap the best way I could,
and, seeing that the priest was a handsome,
genial, good-natured fellow, I appealed to
him. He had a little chat with the policemen,
and they all left.</p>

<p>I sent that priest a box of the best cigars
that I could buy.</p>

<p>Under the counsel and advice of the landlord
I then moved away from there.</p>

<p>I next bought a house, and in the back yard
I built a laboratory with no windows or
doors in it, except a skylight at the top and
the windows and doors that fronted my
house. The walls were of brick, and made
thick. The skylight at the top was a large
one, and was arranged to open up full size.
Special precautions were taken by means of
various attachments to cause the roof to stay
on in case of emergency.</p>

<p>A new apparatus was made and erected
and got ready to test. This time my wife
was my assistant, and we arranged to touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the thing off by electricity from the house.
Again it exploded, and one of the fragments
of the apparatus, coming through the open
door, struck the wooden wall behind which
my wife and I were standing and nearly
passed through it.</p>

<p>On entering the laboratory, I discovered
for the first time what was the actual cause
of the trouble, namely, the longitudinal flaw
already referred to, evidenced by the fragments
of the motorite that remained after
the explosion, for motorite, like smokeless
gunpowder, when subjected to explosive
pressure, is immediately extinguished upon
the release of the pressure, so that when the
apparatus blew up, all of the unconsumed
motorite was extinguished, just as when the
projectile leaves the gun any unburned
smokeless powder is extinguished and is
blown out in front of the gun, where the
partially consumed grains may be recovered.</p>

<p>The next motorite was made by rolling the
material into sheets, cutting into discs, sealing
them together under pressure, and in
that way building up the bars, which precluded
the possibility of there being any
flaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Some motorite was soon made in this manner,
and another apparatus constructed,
which was tested and which worked very satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Following this successful result, I built a
laboratory at a dynamite plant near Lake
Hopatcong for conducting the experiments
on a larger scale.</p>

<p>My assistant at the motorite laboratory
was one of that American country type, absolutely
honest, perfectly fearless, painstaking
and diligent, of such timber as the great
men of the earth are made. He was altogether
a most lovable fellow. He had all his
life worked with explosives, and was a
veteran in the manufacture and use of nitroglycerin
and dynamite. But, when doing
pioneer work with explosives, there is always
an unavoidable element of risk, even
when the greatest care is taken.</p>

<p>We at first had the hydraulic press, in
which we built up the sticks of motorite, located
in the laboratory room itself; but I
suggested to my assistant one day that it
had better be placed outside, and a heavy
brick wall built between us and the press, as
a barricade in case of a possible accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; I said, &#8220;suppose you should by
oversight neglect to put in the leather packing
between the piston and the motorite, we
might have an explosion.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said that he could hardly forget that
precaution. Nevertheless, the press was
placed outside, and the barricade built. The
very first time that we used the press thereafter
he did forget the packing, with the result
that the press exploded. Although we
were behind the barricade, still the concussion
brought us to our knees. Had the explosion
occurred while the press was being
operated in the main laboratory, we should
both have certainly been very seriously injured,
if not killed.</p>

<p>It was a matter of several months before
the full-sized torpedo apparatus with which
we were to experiment was completed and
erected, and the necessary quantity of motorite
made.</p>

<p>On the day before the regular test was to
be conducted, I was called to Morristown,
as expert on a case in court, and I left orders
with my assistant to make up an additional
small quantity of sealing compound, used
for sealing the discs of motorite together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
building up the bars. This sealing material
was made of a mixture of nitroglycerin, guncotton,
camphor and acetate of amyl.</p>

<p>As I did not receive the telegram to go to
Morristown until after I left home that
morning, my wife expected that I would be
working at the laboratory that day, but knew
that I might possibly have a call to Morristown.</p>

<p>On my way home that evening, I was informed
by a neighbor that there had been
an explosion in my laboratory, that my assistant
had been killed, and that the place
had been burned down. I hastened to the
spot and found my wife there waiting for
me. All that was left of my assistant lay
in an adjacent building covered with a piece
of sacking.</p>

<p>That was one of the saddest moments of
my whole life. It is impossible to know what
little slip or misjudgment may have produced
the explosion. A little inadvertence in
the handling of a bottle of nitroglycerin may
have been the cause.</p>

<p>The manner in which my wife was informed
of the accident was about on a par
with that employed by the Irishman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
took the remains of a fellow-workman, killed
by an explosion, home to his wife in a wheelbarrow,
and, knocking upon the door, asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the widdy McGinnis live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>She replied: &#8220;Indade, and I&#8217;m not a
widdy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he said: &#8220;And faith ye are, for I have
his rimnants here in the wheelbarry with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A butcher was the messenger-bearer to
Mrs. Maxim. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Maxim, have you heard the news
about the explosion?&#8221;</p>

<p>And he continued: &#8220;Mr. Maxim&#8217;s laboratory
blew up and burned down today. They
have found some of his assistant, but they
haven&#8217;t found any of Mr. Maxim yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Maxim immediately rushed to the
scene of the accident, where she learned the
welcome news that I was in Morristown that
day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a matter of another year of hard
work before I was again ready to make a
new trial of the torpedo apparatus. There
were several amusing experiences in connection
with that testing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The apparatus held a charge of one hundred
and ten pounds of motorite. Water
was pumped continuously through a water
jacket over the steel cylinders containing the
burning motorite and into the combustion
chamber during each run. The apparatus
was provided with an exhaust valve so constructed
as to control, to a nicety, the pressure
in the combustion chamber.</p>

<p>Under three hundred pounds pressure to
the square inch, which was what was mainly
used, the motorite burned at the rate of a
foot in length per minute, and as each foot
in length weighed twenty-five pounds, it
burned at the rate of twenty-five pounds per
minute. Each pound of motorite evaporated
a little more than two pounds of water, and
the products of combustion, mingling with
the steam produced, escaped from the exhaust
valve through an inch-and-a-half
nozzle.</p>

<p>The roar of the escaping gas and steam
was so great that it was impossible to hear
one shout at the top of his voice. The loudest
shout was less than a whisper. The roar
could be heard with great distinctness more
than two miles away. A good idea can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had of the violence with which the steam and
gases escaped, from the fact that a door,
which accidentally swung shut during one of
the runs in front of the nozzle, although
seven feet distant, was blown from its
hinges, broken in two, and the fragments
hurled twenty feet away. The noise was so
confounding, that it was some time before my
assistants and myself could keep our senses
about us and note and record the pressures
on the various gauges during a run, although
the apparatus was separated from us by a
barricade so strong and heavy that there was
no possibility of our being injured, even
should there be an explosion.</p>

<p>One day, just as we were about to make a
run, the superintendent of a nearby explosives
works called upon us, and I asked him
if he would like to see the run, and he said
he would.</p>

<p>I then asked him to note particularly and
to record the pressure on a certain gauge.
The run lasted about five minutes and, on
turning to him for his notes, he himself was
surprised that he had been so confounded by
the noise that he had not thought of looking
at the gauge at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day when the final test took place,
the firm of torpedo-builders that was interested
with me in the apparatus sent several
representatives, including their chief engineer,
vice-president and other officers of the
company, to witness the test. Everything
being in readiness, and each member of the
committee being convinced that there was no
possible danger in remaining in proximity to
the apparatus and back of the barricade,
while it was being tested, I gave each of the
committee explicit instructions to watch the
various gauges and to note the pressures,
while the chief engineer and myself were to
watch the nozzle gauge, and to observe the
character and force of the steam and gases
escaping from the nozzle.</p>

<p>I told the several members of the committee
it was indispensable that they should carefully
watch the pressure gauges during the
entire run. As it was a condition of the test
that I should get up steam within ten seconds,
the chief engineer stood ready with his stop-watch
when the electric button was pressed
to ignite the motorite.</p>

<p>As the action was instantaneous, that is to
say, as steam was got up practically in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>stantaneously
and was escaping at the nozzle
under full head as quickly as a gun could
be fired, he did not think of his stop-watch,
and it was some little time before I could get
him to look at the pressure gauge on the nozzle,
so as to observe the character of the escaping
steam. His eyes had a blank, meaningless
look, but it must be confessed that he
had the grit to stand there. Not so, however,
with the other members of the committee.
Each of them was far more interested
in his own individual run than he was
in the run of the apparatus, for not one of
them was in sight when the run was completed.
They came straggling back sheepishly,
but no urging sufficed to bring them
near the apparatus during any of the succeeding
runs.</p>

<h2>THE MULE GUN</h2>


<p>In the old days when the Indians were
sometimes troublesome on the Western
frontier, an officer in the regular army,
who was rather an ingenious fellow, conceived
the idea of making a mountain gun
out of a mule and the barrel of a common
field-piece, using the mule for the carriage.
He therefore had the gun securely mounted
on the back of the beast.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far with this
novel battery, when a small knot of hostile
savages was espied quietly eating their midday
meal within easy range. The mounted
gun was forthwith loaded heavily with grape
and canister, the mule taken by the head and
pointed in the direction of the Indians. A
short piece of fuze that had been placed in
the touch-hole of the gun was ignited.</p>

<p>The mule, hearing the sizzing of the fuze,
began to rear and snort and kick and whirl
about, while the officer and his men scudded
to cover, and flattened themselves out upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the ground. They had not long to wait when
there was a terrific crash. The gun had exploded
under the overcharge, with the utter
demolition of the mule carriage.</p>

<p>The Indians, hearing the report, looked
quickly about them, and seeing the fragments
of an exploded mule rocketing through
the air, were frightened nearly out of their
wits, and fled precipitately.</p>

<h2>HOW GUSSIE GOT LOADED</h2>


<p>When I was a young man I taught
several terms of school in Maine,
where, in the small country districts,
the teacher is expected to be a walking
encyclopedia of information.</p>

<p>One day there came a loud knock upon the
door of the schoolhouse. On going out to
see what was the cause of the imperative
summons, I found standing there the wife of
one of the neighbors, white as a sheet with
agitation and alarm. She excitedly told me
that her little boy, Gussie, had just swallowed
a bullet, and she asked me what she
should do for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said I pleasantly, &#8220;Give him a
good charge of gunpowder. But be careful
not to point him toward anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went home and gave him a dose of
gunpowder, without ever seeing the joke.</p>

<h2>DYNAMITE&#8217;S FREAK</h2>


<p>A contractor, who does business up
in New York State, told me the following
story:</p>

<p>A carload of nitroglycerin dynamite had
been shipped to him, but was held up in a
freight-house for a day or two before delivery
to him. One night while it was there,
the freight-house took fire. Hearing the fire-alarm
and looking out, he was astounded to
see that it was the freight-house burning.
Believing that his carload of dynamite would
be sure to explode, he started to run to the
scene in all haste, to warn the firemen and
others to keep far away from the inevitable
explosion, when, suddenly, there was a great
burst of flame, which shot high into the sky
and flared out bright and wild in all directions,
sending up an enormous column of
smoke. But this fierce combustion lasted
only a few minutes, and then subsided.</p>

<p>He knew that his dynamite had burned up,
and, curiously enough, without exploding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>He met the fire chief after the conflagration,
and they spoke of the fire. The chief
remarked that there must have been some
very combustible freight on one of the cars.
He said that, when the fire first started, the
firemen played a full stream of water on this
car, but it did not do any good. The car
burned so fast and so fierce that they had
to rush away for their lives, or they would
have been consumed by the intense heat, and
he wondered what it could be that would
burn so fiercely.</p>

<p>When told that it was a carload of dynamite,
he felt like a man who discovers the
next day that he had, during the night,
walked along the sheer edge of a high precipice.</p>

<p>Although dynamite in such quantities as a
carload when ignited is almost certain to explode
instead of merely burning, still, sometimes,
even that quantity will take fire and
burn up completely without exploding; while,
at other times, a single stick of dynamite
when ignited will detonate.</p>

<h2>EXPLOSIVE VAGARIES</h2>


<p>One of the old importers of picric acid
in this country told me the following
story:</p>

<p>He sold about five tons of picric acid to a
manufacturer of dynamite doing business at
a certain place up the Hudson, for employment
as an ingredient in a particular kind of
high explosive.</p>

<p>Not being very familiar with picric acid
and the character of the exploder necessary
to detonate it, the purchaser had poor success
with it, and he called upon the importer
with the grievance that he had been sold
such a poor lot of picric acid that it was actually
non-explosive, and was therefore practically
worthless, and he wanted the seller to
take it back immediately.</p>

<p>The importer could not convince him that
he was mistaken, although he insisted that it
was only necessary to know how to explode
it, and that, when properly detonated, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one of the most powerful explosives in the
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the purchaser, &#8220;that picric
acid you have sent me is not an explosive.&#8221;</p>

<p>He admitted he knew that picric acid was
recognized as a very powerful explosive; but
he was sure of one thing&mdash;that the picric
acid that had been sent him was not an explosive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is no more explosive
than sand, and I want you to take it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the importer, &#8220;you may
return me a sample of it, and I will submit
it to the requisite tests, and if it proves an
inferior lot I will take it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>That day, during the purchaser&#8217;s absence,
some workmen were moving a barrel of the
picric acid in order to let a plumber mend a
small leak in a lead pipe, which supplied the
place with water. Over and about this lead
pipe had been spilled a considerable quantity
of picric acid, which had formed picrate
of lead with the lead pipe.</p>

<p>The friction from the barrel set off this
picrate of lead, which in turn detonated the
picric acid; and the whole five tons went off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
with such violence as amply to demonstrate
its explosive qualities.</p>

<p>The following day the purchaser returned
to the importer with the complaint that that
picric acid sold him was the most sensitive,
most violent and treacherous explosive
material in the world.</p>

<p>The importer laughed, and reminded him
of their previous conversation. But, as the
dynamite factory had been demolished and
several men killed, the purchaser did not
respond very readily to the humor of the
situation.</p>

<h2>THE TURKEY THAT WENT TO BED</h2>


<p>Possibly it may not be diverging too
much from dynamite stories to tell of
an experience of mine with a steam-cooker,
which I invented away back in the
eighties.</p>

<p>In this cooker I was able to roast and bake
by superheated steam. Sometimes it worked
very well. At other times the safety valve
gave me a great deal of trouble, being altogether
too uncertain in its action.</p>

<p>One day I was sitting alone in the kitchen,
steam-roasting a turkey, when dispossessed
Bridget, who was waiting in an adjoining
room, opened the kitchen door, and took a
sly peep at me. I was endeavoring to convince
her that the thing was perfectly safe,
when, of a sudden, that cooker blew up. The
kitchen windows were blown out, the door
ripped off its hinges, and the stove demolished.</p>

<p>Fortunately, none of the fragments found
either Bridget or me. The oven portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the cooker, containing the turkey, went upstairs
somewhere, through the ceiling. Later
developments showed that the turkey had
gone to bed in the room over the kitchen.</p>

<p>That cooker was my first patent.</p>

<h2>BILL BENNETT, DETECTIVE</h2>


<p>We had a neighbor, when I was a
young man down in Maine, by the
name of Bill Bennett, a hard-working
farmer, who was very proud of his pile
of dry hard wood, which he had prepared for
the winter&#8217;s cold.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn, however, the wood began
to disappear faster than he thought it
ought. He was sure that someone was stealing
it, and inasmuch as his nearest neighbors
had no store of wood whatsoever, and,
too, were notoriously shiftless, he concluded
that they must be the pilferers.</p>

<p>A little bit of detective work that he practiced
to ascertain the truth of his conclusions
was certainly ingenious and worked
well.</p>

<p>Bennett took a dozen sticks of wood, and
bored a large hole in the end of each of them,
which he filled with rifle powder, putting
about a pound into each stick. He then
plugged the holes skillfully to conceal the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
evidences of his work, sawing off a short bit
of the plugged end of each stick, so that the
plug would not show, and distributed these
sticks upon the part of the pile that was
shrinking. He was careful to select the wood
for his own burning from another portion of
the heap.</p>

<p>The following evening he was looking from
his window toward the house of the neighbors,
wondering how long it would be before
his ingenuity bore fruit, when suddenly there
was a flash, a crash and a roar, followed by
screams of &#8220;Murder!&#8221; and &#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mystery had been solved.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>




<h2>WINNING THE OX</h2>


<p>This Bill Bennett was a good deal
of a marksman, and one day while
attending a county fair, where he
had imbibed a considerable measure of bottled-up
unsteadiness, he came reeling along
to a group of men who were engaged in
shooting at a target. The range was long,
and the price paid by each contestant for a
chance to display his skill, or lack of it, was
a dollar a shot, but the prize was a fat ox,
which was destined to go to the first who
made a bull&#8217;s-eye. As yet none had succeeded
in making the lucky shot.</p>

<p>Bill staggered into position, and threw
down a ten-dollar bill for ten shots. The attendants
steadied him sufficiently to confine
his wild target practice to that part of the
sky and horizon where the target was located.</p>

<p>Bill had wasted nine shots without coming
within speaking distance of the target, which
to his drunken sight appeared to be double.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Rolling like a ship in a storm, Bill brought
the gun to his shoulder for the last round,
declaring, &#8220;By gum, I&#8217;m agoing to hit one
of them targets this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he did. As they went sailing by, he
let blaze at them, and behold, it was a bull&#8217;s-eye!
Bill had won the ox on a one-to-a-million
chance.</p>

<h2>A DUEL TO THE DEATH</h2>


<p>In the old pioneer days of Maine, when it
was still a province of Massachusetts, a
young French officer had an altercation
with the chief of the Oldtown Indians, and
according to the custom of the times, challenged
the Red Man to fight a duel with him.</p>

<p>The old Indian, according to the courtesies
of the game, was allowed the choice of
weapons, and he chose two kegs of gunpowder.
Each was to sit upon a keg, with the
bung out. Then two pistols were to be discharged
in succession. On the firing of the
first pistol, two iron pokers, heated to a
white heat, were to be laid upon a table beside
the duelists, which was to be immediately
followed by the discharge of the second
pistol. At this signal they were each to
seize a poker and thrust it into the bung-hole
of the keg on which his adversary was sitting,
the old Indian calculating that he would
be quicker than the Frenchman.</p>

<p>But the Frenchman had a little calcula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>tion
of his own, and he figured out something
that the Indian had doubtless not thought of.
This was that the explosion of either keg
would be certain to explode the other.</p>

<p>But he made a bluff of it, thinking that the
old Indian too might be bluffing, and so everything
was arranged. Each mounted his respective
keg and the first pistol was fired.
The savage was a graven image, but the
Frenchman did not wait for the second signal,
and unlike Lot&#8217;s wife, he never looked
back.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE BEWITCHED FLINTLOCK</h2>


<p>My father used to tell a good story
about a one-time chief of the Oldtown
Indians, and, as it had to do
in a way with explosions&mdash;indeed, a series
of them&mdash;I add it to my collection.</p>

<p>There was a farmer living in an adjacent
town, who frequently received visits from
the old chief. On such occasions, the Red
Man always carried his shotgun with him.
The weapon, according to the times, was a
flintlock, single-barreled muzzle-loader.</p>

<p>One day in the autumn, the farmer was
feeding his turkeys by stringing a long line
of corn upon the ground, on either side of
which the turkeys were standing, head to
head, in two opposing ranks for the feeding.
The Indian was present, and the farmer
asked his guest what he would give for a
shot at that double line of turkeys&#8217; heads.
The Indian answered that he would give five
dollars, if he could have every turkey that
he killed or wounded. The farmer, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
previously drawn the shot from the Indian&#8217;s
gun, leaving only the powder charge, accepted
the offer.</p>

<p>The Indian leveled his gun and fired; but
not a turkey fell. The old Red Man looked
puzzled. The farmer laughed at his marksmanship,
but the old savage merely grunted,
and went home.</p>

<p>The chief appeared again next day, and
the farmer asked him how he would like to
take another shot, having again drawn off
a charge of shot from the Indian&#8217;s gun.
He would gladly give another five dollars
for a try. This time the discharge of
the gun brought down a goodly number of
turkeys. The Indian had taken the precaution
of loading his gun with a double charge
of shot. On the next visit received from
the Indian, the farmer unloaded the gun
down to the powder charge, then put in a
wad of punk, and another powder charge
with another wad of punk, and so on, until
he had loaded the weapon nearly to the muzzle.
He then replaced the gun in its position
in the corner, dropped a fire-coal into
the muzzle, and invited the Indian to supper.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few minutes, the In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>dian&#8217;s
gun went off, bang! Much surprised,
the Indian looked around, and remarked that
it was a strange occurrence, that he had
never before known his gun to go off by itself.
While he was still cogitating over the
strange occurrence, bang! went the old gun
again.</p>

<p>The Indian hurried through his supper,
very greatly perturbed, but he had not quite
finished when the old gun spoke yet once
again. The chief rose from the table hurriedly,
seized his ancient weapon, and started
off for home with as nearly a display of
agitation as is permissible to the dignity of
the Red Man. Before he had gone far, however,
the old gun uttered another bang! He
then broke into a rapid run, and just as he
arrived at his wigwam, the gun banged
again. Now thoroughly frightened, he
hurled it from him over a fence. Still, for
more than two hours the Indian&#8217;s weapon
continued its mysterious barking.</p>

<p>When the farmer explained the trick to the
old chief, he felt that he had been somewhat
compensated for the loss of his turkeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2>WHEN HE SHIRKED</h2>


<p>A prominent financier, who was a
much better business man than he was
inventor, read of Moissan&#8217;s experiments
in making artificial diamonds. The
financier conceived the idea of converting anthracite
coal directly into diamonds by subjecting
it to enormous pressure of gunpowder
exploded in a strong steel cylinder.</p>

<p>As he wished to market a large quantity
of his manufactured diamonds before their
artificial character should leak out, he determined
to conduct his experiments very secretly;
consequently, he put the man-of-all-work
at his country place upon the job. This
faithful and useful servant was to report the
progress of the work regularly at the city
office of his employer.</p>

<p>After trying several experiments with
black gunpowder, the man reported that the
scheme didn&#8217;t work&mdash;that no diamonds were
produced.</p>

<p>The financier then told the useful that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had evidently reached the limit of power of
black gunpowder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now try dynamite,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>There was a break in the chain of reports,
and he wrote the useful, asking him why
he did not report. Still no answer.</p>

<p>After waiting some days, the idea suddenly
struck the financier that possibly the
process had proved successful and that the
useful planned to betray him. He accordingly
sent a peremptory telegram to him to
report at once on pain of discharge.</p>

<p>The next day a vision, swathed and bandaged
and perambulating on crutches, entered
his office.</p>

<p>&#8220;You infernal old scoundrel!&#8221; yelled the
wreck, as he entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> &#8220;Blow a man up with
dynamite, and then threaten to discharge
him for not reporting!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE ELEVATION OF WOMANHOOD</h2>


<p>I had a certain man in my employ down
at Maxim by the name of Benjamin Billings,
whom we called Ben Billingsgate.
Ben held views very strongly prejudicial to
dogs and matrimony. He was all that
is implied by the term &#8220;all-round useful.&#8221;
Though an erratic fellow, he was bright and
energetic and seemed to be able to do anything
under the sun when he set about it.
But he lacked initiative, except in the expression
of his opinions about those two abominations&mdash;dogs
and matrimony.</p>

<p>When he was young and ardent he had
married Sukyanna, a maiden who was dominated
by the delusion that she had been born
with a mission, to which all other considerations
were secondary and should be subordinated.
She was also a woman with a pug
dog. Benjamin&#8217;s nerves had been frazzling
out for some time, and his patience was
sorely tried by the division of the lady&#8217;s af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>fections
between him and the dog&mdash;with a decided
leaning toward the dog.</p>

<p>One day he brought home to his wife a
beautiful Christmas present, which consisted
of a large colored photograph of himself,
mounted in an exquisite gilt frame. The expense
of the thing represented a week&#8217;s hard
labor, but he wanted to create an impression
upon his wife. He believed in doing things
by wholes and in striking hard to win. His
wife was very pleased&mdash;with the frame.</p>

<p>On his return from work the following
evening, he took a sidelong glance toward
the mantel over which the picture had been
hung. He did not recognize himself. There
in the frame was a life-size photograph of
the pug in place of his, which Sukyanna had
removed.</p>

<p>He uttered never a word, but his whole
mental mechanism was turning somersaults.
The next day, at roll-call, that dog was reported
among the missing.</p>

<p>Benjamin pretended to sympathize and to
condole with his wife, but she was disconsolate.
Some Gypsies had passed that way
during the day, and it was suspected that
they might have stolen the dog. The horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was accordingly hitched up and a drive of
ten miles was taken. When the Gypsies were
overhauled and rounded up, the pug was not
discovered. Then an advertisement was inserted
in all the town papers. Still no pug.
The canine continued a persistent absentee.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Benjamin had devoted
ingenuity enough to the destruction of that
dog to form the basis of a Sherlock Holmes
detective story. He had prepared a sort of
canister-bomb, adapted to go off by a strong
thump of any sort. The dog, the bomb and
a stout rawhide string, with which to tether
the bomb to the dog, were confidingly placed
in the hands of a small boy in the neighborhood,
known to have both a sense of humor
and a taste for the mischievous. The boy
was, however, fond of dogs, and it eventuated
that he decided to keep the dog for himself.
Hence the delay in the finale of this
story.</p>

<p>But the urchin&#8217;s sense of humor finally got
the better of his affection. He found it impossible
to choke off the appeal to his
imagination of hitching that bomb to the
dog&#8217;s tail. Consequently he took the pug out
and carefully tied the canister to its tail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Following the ingenious instructions of Benjamin,
as soon as he had done so he dodged
into the house and shut the door before the
dog realized what had happened.</p>

<p>When the pug discovered itself a part of
an infernal machine, old-home-week associations
rose up in its memory, and it made a
bee-line for home and human mother.</p>

<p>Benjamin had made a little miscalculation
about the amount of thumping that would be
required to actuate the exploding mechanism
of his ingenious bomb, and it did not explode
immediately, as expected. The dog and
bomb, consequently, hurtled through space
like a comet with a head on both ends of the
tail.</p>

<p>On the dog&#8217;s arrival, Sukyanna was going
about her household duties, with a book in
one hand written by Miriam Mushroom on
The Transcendentalism of the Universal,
and Its Relevancy to the Elevation of Womanhood;
while, with the other hand, directed
only by subconscious mental process
born of habit, she was preparing supper for
Benjamin. She prided herself on that power
of concentration and absorption, so common
to the artistic temperament, which can re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>sist
for a while the battering-ram assaults
on consciousness of howling children, barking
dogs, or a house on fire.</p>

<p>As a result, she did not hear or see puggy
as, with whine and din and clatter, he rushed
into the room where she stood. Not receiving
the expected attention and consolation,
puggy in his impatience circled around the
human mother, entwining the shanks of her
in the strong rawhide cord, until dog and
bomb had effectually hobbled her skirts,
when, tripping, she went down on both.</p>

<p>This mean trick on the part of Benjamin
bruised her artistic soul and proved far too
much; she instantly separated from Benjamin&mdash;in
the direction of the empyrean.</p>

<p>She had at last achieved the realization of
the Elevation of Womanhood.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>




<h2>DIDN&#8217;T KNOW IT WAS LOADED</h2>


<p>At the works of the Maxim-Nordenfelt
Company in England, when some of
the early experiments with smokeless
powders were being made in that company&#8217;s
laboratory, a strong hydraulic cylinder, which
had been employed for compressing experimental
explosive materials, was thrown out
of commission by the ram, or plunger, sticking
in the cylinder. The cylinder was taken
to the shop, and the job of getting the
plunger out of it was given to one of the
workmen. He thereupon commenced in his
own peculiar way by heating the cylinder
over a forge, thinking to expand it sufficiently
to allow the plunger to be removed.</p>

<p>He succeeded before long, with an effectuality
that perfectly dumbfounded his slow
sense of expedition. The contained explosive
naturally ignited, and the plunger was
blown out like a shot from a cannon. The
cylinder itself was blown downward, demolishing
the forge, passing through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
plank floor, and burying itself in the ground,
while the plunger whizzed upward through
the roof, and disappeared in the direction of
Scotland.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE WRONG TAP</h2>


<p>The worker among high explosive materials
must never relax his ceaseless
vigilance. Not only his own life, but
also the lives of those working at his side,
hang upon the thread of infinite care. This
fact is emphatically illustrated by an experience
of my own, while conducting some experiments
with a continuous process for
making nitroglycerin which I had invented.</p>

<p>Orders were waiting, and it would take a
week of constant labor on my part to complete
the apparatus. I therefore crowded
the week into three days, working constantly
day and night, without a moment&#8217;s sleep or
rest.</p>

<p>I had thought out every detail of the
process with the utmost care. I had tested
every step, unit by unit, so I was confident
not only that the process would prove successful,
but also that it would be safe to
operate.</p>

<p>On the forenoon of the third day, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>thing
being at last in readiness, I now prepared
to turn on the acids and the glycerin.
I was well aware of the grim possibilities of
my being killed, for if I had made a miscalculation
or any wrong determination, I
knew that my life might be the forfeit. I
gave little thought to the likelihood of my
being incautious due to the tremendous
strain to which I had so long subjected myself.
As it happened, I was so worn out that
at the very outset I turned on the glycerin
first, instead of the acids. My hand was actually
upon the acids tap before I realized
my error.</p>

<p>In that vital moment, some secret sense or
instinct called back my wandering wits in the
nick of time, and, shuddering, I dropped my
fingers from the tap. Had I turned it on
after the glycerin began to flow, I must inevitably
have been blown to pieces.</p>

<h2>&#8220;WHENCE ALL BUT HIM HAD FLED&#8221;</h2>


<p>I have a literary friend by the name of
Marvin Dana, who, although he was for
years editor of the <cite>Smart Set</cite>, once
failed in a bit of à priori perspicuity. Some
Italians were blasting out a bit of rock at
Landing for the foundation of a new bridge,
to carry the roadway over the railroad in
that village. They had just finished charging
a big, deep hole with dynamite, and had
lighted the fuze, when Marvin started to
cross the temporary bridge with his usual
measured stride of ever-conscious dignity.
The Italians, who had withdrawn to a safe
distance, seeing him coming, and they being
unable to speak English, gesticulated wildly,
and pointed excitedly in the direction of the
blast under the bridge.</p>

<p>The littérateur concluded that there must
be something extraordinary going on down
below there&mdash;something quite worth looking
at, and, walking directly above the blast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
leaned over the bridge and looked down.
Just at that instant the mine exploded.</p>

<p>He was, happily, unhurt by any of the flying
stones and débris, but the knock-down
argument of the shock from the blast convinced
him that such carelessness on the part
of those Italians, with never a guard to wave
a red flag warning pedestrians, was, indeed,
truly shocking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2>BREAKING HIS NERVE</h2>


<p>Just back upon the hills that rise up
from the southern shores of Lake Hopatcong,
there is one of the most important
dynamite works in the country.
James Wentworth began his labors there
first as an errand boy, at the age of twelve,
soon after the works started. It was his
brag that he had grown up with the works,
but that he had never gone up with them,
although he had seen many another go up,
when, on occasion, by some freak of chance,
a packing-house or a nitroglycerin apparatus
would be blown to the four winds of heaven,
spraying wreckage of men and timber over
the whole celestial concave.</p>

<p>Jim had no lack of courage. He had
worked in every department of the business;
had made nitroglycerin and nitrogelatin, and
had become one of the most skillful dynamite
packers. As he did piece-work, he made
money rapidly.</p>

<p>One day, at a church strawberry festival,
he was drawn into the vortex of that swirl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>ing
passion, love, and married. The young
wife importuned him to give up the dynamite
business, as he had already laid up
sufficient money to start him in another business.
Yielding to her wishes, he gave notice
that his resignation was to take effect at the
end of two weeks.</p>

<p>On the third day of the period of his
notice, on the advent of the noon hour, he
was seized with an uncontrollable impulse to
take his dinner-pail and himself out of the
packing-house where he was working. He
said afterward that he got to thinking, &#8220;Suppose
this packing-house should blow up;
what would become of Susie?&#8221;&mdash;to say nothing
of his own dispersion.</p>

<p>He went to the top of an elevation to eat
his dinner, in full view of the packing-house,
continuing his pessimistic reflections.</p>

<p>The place began to look suspicious. For
the first time in his life he felt fear. On a
sudden, that packing-house became a white,
dazzling ball of flame, and he was knocked
down by the concussion.</p>

<p>He told the superintendent that the three
days he had served on his notice must suffice&mdash;he

<h2>THE GRIZZLY CANNON BALL</h2>


<p>In the early days, when there was more
individual and less corporate mining in
the gold country of the West, a long and
lean Yankee, Jim Evans, who was once a
neighbor of mine in Maine, contracted the
gold-fever, and went West.</p>

<p>Luckily, he almost immediately struck a
pay streak high up the face of a cliff, where
there was a wide shelf of rock that afforded
a very convenient roadway for his use, as
well as considerable area for the transaction
of his operations.</p>

<p>Someone before him had started operations
on the same site, but had become discouraged
and quit, leaving a big steel tank,
open at one end, lying upon its side, the open
end pointing, like a huge cannon, over the
mining settlement a thousand feet below.
Jim used this tank to warehouse certain edibles,
together with a keg of black gunpowder.</p>

<p>One day, on Jim&#8217;s return from grubbing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the ground, he was amazed to find the entrance
to his warehouse blocked by a huge
grizzly bear that had crawled in to get at the
edibles, and that fitted the big tube like a wad
in a gun.</p>

<p>Jim was addicted to humor, and as there
was a three-quarter-inch hole in the tank
near the closed end right over the keg of gunpowder,
the head of which had been removed,
it occurred to him that he might
make it somewhat interesting for the bear
by lighting a piece of fuze and dropping it
into the gunpowder. This he proceeded to
do, and the bear proceeded to leave that tube
after the manner of a cannon ball.</p>

<p>Hearing the report, and seeing a large
volume of smoke, the townspeople, looking
skyward and Jim-ward, were astonished at
seeing a ton of grizzly hurtling outward
from Jim&#8217;s place and descending upon them.</p>

<p>On Jim&#8217;s return to the village that evening,
he was surrounded by numerous interrogators
regarding the bear. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he
said, casually, &#8220;I found the bear in my
shack, and just threw him out, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>THE JOKE WAS NOT ON THE
CHINAMEN</h2>


<p>When the Alaskan gold excitement
was at its height, a couple of adventurous
spirits, prospectors from
California, had expended several months of
precious, good old summer-time and exhausted
their resources in an endeavor to locate
pay dirt by sinking a shaft into a narrow
table of land which jutted out from a
high mountain near its base.</p>

<p>After thawing and grubbing and blasting
through fifty feet of earth, with no gold in
sight, they came upon solid ice underlying
the cover of earth through which they had
penetrated.</p>

<p>They kept on, however, for several weeks
more, in an endeavor to penetrate through
the ice; but they found ice, and only ice, for
another fifty feet.</p>

<p>Then it was that it occurred to them to
salt that ice with fine gold dust and sell out
to some tenderfoot sucker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>They very easily found the desired victims
in two Chinamen, with evident ample
means and sufficient lack of experience.</p>

<p>The two prospectors had about a ton of
dynamite on hand. This they lowered into
the shaft and concealed it in a side drift just
deep enough and big enough to hold it, calculating
that the first shot fired by the
Chinamen would set off the dynamite and, by
completely demolishing the shaft, conceal
their fraud.</p>

<p>The first blast made by the Chinamen did
explode the dynamite, which not only
wrecked the shaft, but also lifted the whole
jutting bit of tableland&mdash;ice, earth, everything&mdash;sending
it&mdash;an avalanche&mdash;down the
mountain slope several hundred feet, exposing
a thick stratum of glacial detritus, under
where the ice had been, so full of gold that
it proved to be one of the richest finds ever
made in Alaska. The one blast had made the
Chinamen millionaires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHINESE FIREWORKS</h2>


<p>During the gold-digging days of California,
before there was a restriction
imposed upon the immigration of
Chinese, a big American sailing vessel, while
in Chinese waters, had taken aboard a large
cargo of fireworks and a few tons of gunpowder
of a special brand, which was safely
housed in the hold, while all the sleeping
quarters except those occupied by the crew,
and all available deck spaces, were filled with
a cargo of coolies to man California mines.</p>

<p>The vessel was one of those staunch, fast,
sail-driven craft brought to their highest
perfection in the shipyards of Maine just before
the advent of the steamship.</p>

<p>When the ship was about a day out on its
homeward voyage, the captain learned,
through his faithful Chinese cook, that a big
part of the Chinamen that he had picked up
were half-breed Malay and Chinese pirates
who had taken passage for the sole purpose
of capturing the ship for piratical purposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and that they were armed to the teeth, so
that resistance offered by his crew of only
twelve would be utterly hopeless.</p>

<p>While the captain was deliberating upon
what to do, word was brought by his cook
that the pirate horde were beginning to act
very ugly, and had already taken possession
of the fore part of the vessel, preparatory
to a final assault upon the crew.</p>

<p>The captain ordered two lifeboats immediately
to be filled with water and provisions
and lowered, while he went below decks
and lighted a train to the cargo of gunpowder
and fireworks. Then the captain and his
crew, together with the Chinese cook, manned
the lifeboats and pulled away, to the amazement
of the Chinese pirates, who seemed
immensely pleased that they had captured
the ship without a struggle.</p>

<p>The captain and the crew, in his two boats,
lay on their oars at a safe distance quietly
watching events, while the ship, which had
now been turned about, was sailing away
landward. When at a distance of about half
a mile, that ship turned volcano. The whole
above-water portion went up into the air
with a belch of fire and thunder-roar like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
another Krakatoa, whose eruption shook the
whole earth in 1883.</p>

<p>In their upward flight, Chinamen raced
with rockets, while the heaven was filled with
burning fireworks&mdash;and then it rained Chinamen.
In fact, it was a real cloudburst of
Chinamen, fire-crackers and ship&#8217;s wreckage.</p>

<h2>BROWN, THE GUNNER</h2>


<p>For many years, all inventors and
manufacturers having occasion to attend
experiments with their productions
at the Naval Proving Grounds at Indian
Head, were aided in their work by
Brown, the gunner. He was a very ingenious,
genial, gigantic fellow, one of the most
likable men in the world. There was nothing
about the mechanism of guns and gunnery
unfamiliar to him.</p>

<p>Once, during the early years of his service
there, a fragment from an exploding gun
struck him in the forehead, leaving a great
dent. As soon as he recovered, he returned
to his duties undeterred, although he had had
many other close calls.</p>

<p>One day, a few years ago, he walked in on
me at my summer home on Lake Hopatcong.
During his visit, he asked me if I believed
in presentiments. He said he had had a very
strange presentiment of impending danger
in his work at Indian Head. He told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he had confided this to the commanding
officer there, who laughed at him, and said,
&#8220;Oh, Brown, at last you are losing your
nerve. Go and take a two weeks&#8217; vacation,
and then come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brown did go back at the end of his
vacation.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, while testing a new
heavy gun, something went wrong. The
breech block blew out, and Brown was
killed.</p>

<h2>THE HAPPENING OF THE UNEXPECTED</h2>


<p>Some time ago, a young lady who had
been my private secretary for about
four years got married. Thinking that
one of the best ways of securing another
competent stenographer and typist to take
her place would be to go to an employment
agency, Mrs. Maxim and I called upon the
manager of one of those institutions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maxim, according to the habitude of
her sex, led in the conversation. She told
the manager about the unusual requirements
that the person engaged must have&mdash;that she
must have a good general education, must
be very expert as stenographer and typist,
and above all, must be an exceptionally good
speller. Furthermore, Mrs. Maxim placed
especial emphasis upon one stipulation&mdash;that
we did not want a girl under twenty or
a woman over thirty-five, for the reason that
a girl under twenty is very apt to lack the
necessary experience and serious-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>ness
for such a position, while a woman
around and above forty is apt to be set in
her ways, and to lack the necessary flexibility
of mind and nature readily to adapt herself
to anything to which she has not always
been accustomed, and is, furthermore, likely
to be unable to learn anything new with the
facility of a younger person.</p>

<p>The manager was all suavity, pleasant
manners and promises, and assured us that
he had on his waiting list a number of young
women who would exactly meet our requirements,
and that he would send three of them
over that very evening.</p>

<p>We learned from the bit of experience
which followed that employment agencies
and those who are sent by them to apply for
positions, are apt to be governed by reasoning
similar to that of the small boy, who,
seeing an advertisement that twenty-five dollars&#8217;
reward would be paid for a Pekinese
spaniel, thought it would do no harm to try,
and so he called to claim the reward with
a huge mongrel&mdash;a cross between a Newfoundland
and a St. Bernard.</p>

<p>Well, at the appointed hour, two archaic
dilapidations wafted themselves in upon us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
who looked as though their nascency had a
priority on the Stone Age and they had been
vouchsafed to us among the antediluvian
survivors of Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>

<p>The first one&mdash;a slip of a girl of some
sixty-seven to the nth-power summers and as
many winters&mdash;betrayed her lack of typistical
experience by mistaking a national cash
register for a typewriter. Then she confided
in us the little confidence that she really
knew nothing about typewriting as yet, but
that, in the sweet long ago, in the days of
auld lang syne, she used to drum quite a lot
on the piano, and, consequently, she imagined
that typewriting, being a sort of mere finger
play, would come so easy to her that she
would have little difficulty in acquiring the
necessary aptitude on a typewriter to qualify
for the position.</p>

<p>The next applicant was a tall, slight, sinuous,
willowy, sylph-like and ethereal creature
of the hippopotamus variety, who floated
into our presence like a breath of old winter,
made sweet summer by the mingled odor of
violets, lilacs, musk and new-mown hay. I
gave her a short dictation, which she took
down in longhand. I asked her why she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
not write shorthand. She said she did write
shorthand, unless she was in a hurry. Contemplating
her huge bulk, I insinuated that
we should want someone a little lighter on
her corns than she, as one of the desirable
accomplishments in a private secretary was
that she should be able to play tennis. She
said that although she had never played tennis
herself, still it ran in the family, because
her grandchildren were expert tennis
players.</p>

<p>When the third antique entered, the thing
began to get monotonous, as Mark Twain
remarked, when a mule had fallen through
his tent three times in one evening. We
were getting out of patience. I told the old
lady at once that we did not want anyone
under twenty or over thirty-five. She assured
me that she was not under twenty. I
told her that I had guessed as much, and
asked, &#8220;How about the other limit!&#8221; She
sharply retorted that she had never, in all
her life, touched thirty-five. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said I,
&#8220;if that be so, you must have been skidding
some when you went by that numeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disappointed, and highly indignant, we
called again the next day upon that manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the employment agency. He was profoundly
apologetic, and said that he happened
to have waiting in another room a young
lady who was exactly what we wanted. She
was immediately asked into the private office,
where Mrs. Maxim and I examined her. She
was about twenty-five years of age, and was,
as they say down in Maine, as smart as a
steel trap. I gave her a dictation replete
with multi-syllabic terminology, and with unusual
words of difficult orthography, but she
took down everything with lightning speed,
read back her notes to perfection, and transcribed
them rapidly on the typewriter without
a mistake.</p>

<p>We asked for what salary she would be
willing to come to us. The salary asked was
pretty high, but we instantly agreed to pay
it. The manager and the young lady exchanged
glances, and both looked a bit surprised.
Mrs. Maxim and I then asked if we
might talk with the young lady alone for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>After some Sherlock Holmesy talk with
the young woman, Mrs. Maxim and I came
to the conclusion that she was a show girl
kept by the manager merely to prove that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
he had the goods when required, provided
anyone wished to pay a sufficiently high
salary, and the salary was made high enough
to deter most applicants. We got it from
the girl that she had several times been hired
and had worked a few days for each of a
number of employers, until she could find
some rational excuse for breaking away and
returning to the agency, the manager of
which, we also learned, was her brother, and
she was a partner in the business.</p>

<p>The incident reminded me of a story told
by a friend of mine in New York who bought
a beautiful and highly trained Scotch terrier
of a Broadway dog vendor, thinking that
after keeping the dog tied up for a week, feeding
him and treating him with kindness, he
could be depended upon to stay with his new
master, but the moment the dog was freed he
disappeared, and the next day he was again
with his master, the dog vendor, ready to be
resold. Some time later, a light was thrown
upon the inner consciousness of my friend
by reading an account in the newspapers of
the arrest of the dog vendor for obtaining
money under false pretenses and practicing
fraud in the sale of dogs, or rather, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
dog. The canine was a sort of homing-pigeon
dog, trained, like a carrier pigeon, to
return from each new master as soon as
freed. The buying and selling of that one
dog constituted the main business of the
scamp.</p>

<p>When our interview with the young woman
was concluded, we started to leave the office
in disgust, but at that moment a young
woman of rather prepossessing appearance,
about thirty years of age, entered the office
looking for a position. She explained that
her late employer having gone to Europe,
she was looking for a new place.</p>

<p>After a critical examination, we found that
she would meet our requirements very well.
Then it developed that, having read in newspapers
and magazines some of the accounts,
highly colored by the writers of them, of how
I cooked with high explosives and lighted my
cigar with a stick of dynamite, and burned
nitroglycerin in a lamp to light the room,
she, being of a rather nervous temperament,
was afraid of the prospective companionship
with explosive materials.</p>

<p>I assured her that the accounts were misrepresentations
of actual facts, and ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>plained
that we lived at a very safe distance
from any explosive works, and that she
would be exposed to no danger whatsoever.
I finally convinced her that our home was a
safe place, and although still harassed with
some doubts she decided to come with us.</p>

<p>In the edge of the evening, after her arrival,
she and I were sitting at the dining-room
table engaged in conversation. I was
telling her how groundless had been her
fears, when there came a terrific explosion.
The sky was lighted up with a brilliancy that
would shame the noon-day sun, and fragments
of brands from the burning fell all
about the house.</p>

<p>I confess that I was as much surprised as
she was&mdash;and that was going some. I rushed
out, and found that my tool-house, located
about a hundred yards from my residence,
had blown up, and the wreckage was on fire.
Being sure that there were no explosives in
the building, I was greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>There were in the place at the time perhaps
a hundred rounds of Mauser rifle cartridges.
These were exploding, one after
another, from the heat. The neighbors who
had run to witness the fire, were greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
frightened, and did not dare to render any
assistance in putting out the flames, especially
while the cartridges were exploding.</p>

<p>I ran to a hydrant nearby, got out the fire-hose,
and found, to my amazement, what one
usually finds under such circumstances, that
the nozzle of the hose had been taken off,
and the hose disconnected from the hydrant,
and that there was no wrench there. I ran
and got another hose and a wrench, made
the connections, and ran out the hose to extinguish
the fire, when I found that only a
small stream of water as big as my thumb
flowed from the hose. I then ran down to
my house to see if there were any faucets
open which would reduce the pressure, and
then to the pump-house to measure the water
in the supply tank, and found that the tank
was nearly full, and that thirty-five thousand
gallons of water were available for extinguishing
the fire. Yet I could get no pressure.
The result was that nothing was
saved, and the building and all its contents
were a complete loss. As there was no insurance,
the loss was about fifteen hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>After it was too late to save the building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I walked down to the Hotel Durban, on my
property, which I supplied with water, to
calm the fears of some of the guests who
were agitated, when, to my amazement, I
found a two-inch fire-hose turned on full,
and running in the road. I learned then that
a stupid fellow who was staying at the hotel,
had turned the water on at several fire hydrants
to play water on the hotel, although
the hotel was at such a safe distance from the
tool-house that there was not a particle of
danger whatsoever. It never occurred to
him to close off one hydrant when he opened
another; consequently, the pressure was reduced
so that no water at all could be had
at the scene of the fire, and not pressure
enough on the hose-pipes that he had turned
on to do any good even had they been
needed.</p>

<p>After things had quieted down, I returned
to the house to resume my conversation, and
to repeat my assurances to the young lady
secretary, but I found a polite note tacked to
the table-cloth, requesting that her trunk be
forwarded the next day. She had not waited
for further conviction as to the safety of her
new position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>On investigation, I learned that a fire
had started in the tool-house from some
cause unknown, and had proceeded long
enough to get one side of the interior of
the building well ablaze. As there were
five gallons of denatured alcohol in the
place, and the same quantity of gasoline, and
about ten pounds of sulphuric ether, it is
probable that one of these had become heated
and, bursting, set free a lot of vapor which,
mixing with the atmosphere, exploded. There
were also in the building about thirty pounds
of finely pulverized aluminum, ten pounds
of magnesium powder and other ingredients
for flashlight powders, with which I intended
to conduct experiments. As these materials
were not mixed, they were not explosive,
but their combustion was what produced the
wonderful light when the explosion occurred.
The result was not like that from an explosion
of dynamite, in which case the building
would have been literally blown to fragments,
but, as is usual in gas explosions, the
roof of the building was lifted up, the sides
thrown out, and the roof dropped in. Even
the front door of the building, charred from
the initial fire, was found otherwise intact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>While sitting on the porch of my house on
Lake Hopatcong, dictating this story to my
stenographer, and when I had arrived at
this point, she suddenly called to me,
&#8220;Look!&#8221; pointing her finger across the
Lake to a huge column of smoke going up
from the Atlas Powder Works, and mushrooming
out into the sky. The direct distance
is about three miles, but it seemed quite
a long time before we felt the shock and
heard the sound. Although the sound was
loud and the shock considerable, the sound
was much louder and the shock much heavier
even at longer distances in several directions,
owing, I imagine, to the difference in
the underlying strata of earth.</p>

<p>As I learned later, the explosion took
place at one of the packing houses, which
carried another packing house with it, together
with a nitroglycerin storehouse, so
that about ten tons of dynamite, or its
equivalent, went up in that column of smoke.
I understand that seven men were killed,
and about twice as many injured. It was
the largest and most destructive explosion
that had ever occurred at those works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>




<h2>WHEN THE WASH VANISHED</h2>


<p>I was once invited to speak at a County
Fair at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where
I used to live when in the publishing
business. My subject was Explosive Materials
and Their Use in Warfare.</p>

<p>The management was especially desirous
that I should give my auditors some sort of
spectacular demonstration, to show what explosives
would do. A platform was erected
in an open field, and I had an arena roped
off at the rear of the platform about fifty
feet wide, and running back several hundred
feet. In the rear portion of this arena I
buried several sticks of dynamite, and connected
them with an exploder and a battery
on the platform.</p>

<p>Also, I brought several cotton bosom-shirts,
several cotton undershirts, half-a-dozen
handkerchiefs, a couple of towels, half-a-dozen
pairs of cotton socks, and as many
cheap cotton collars and cuffs. These I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
immersed in a concentrated mixture of nitric
and sulphuric acids, converting them all into
guncotton. Then I washed and soaked the
acid out of them, and dried them.</p>

<p>I stretched a clothes-line from the speaker&#8217;s
platform to a distance of about thirty
feet to my right, and on this I hung my guncotton
clothes, only a few feet away from the
front of the audience.</p>

<p>There were, perhaps, a thousand people
massed in front of me, crowding up close,
that nothing should miss them. I made a
brief talk on the nature and use of explosives,
and burned some smokeless powder
under water, and then I touched off the dynamite
in the rear of the field, which made
a very pretty showing.</p>

<p>The audience was very curious about that
wash. That I should have hung my linen out
to dry on that occasion they thought was very
peculiar taste, to say the least; and some of
them did not hesitate to say that they considered
it very bad taste.</p>

<p>I then said to the audience that I must beg
their pardon for displaying my underwear
as I had done; that I appreciated the fact
that it was an unsightly display, and, to ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>commodate
them, I would immediately proceed
to get it out of sight. I then touched
it off with an electrical igniter, and that
laundry disappeared in one great bright
flash of flame.</p>

<p>There happened to be in my audience an
ingenious fellow with some knowledge of
chemistry, who was a noted wag and practical
joker. Taking the hint from my nitrated
laundry, he nitrated a cotton handkerchief
and sent it to the Chinese laundry
with the rest of his wash.</p>

<p>When he called for his clothes, he found
John Chinaman with his right arm in a sling.
However, John was all smiles, and apologized
for the absence of the one handkerchief, but
said nothing more about it.</p>

<p>A short time after the fellow had put on
his clean underwear, he developed a very
severe case of prickly heat, followed, a little
later, by a sensation like that of needles being
stuck into his body over the entire surface.
Anyone who has taken a bite of a wild
Indian turnip knows what that sensation is.
The Chinaman had charged his customer&#8217;s
garments with a preparation extracted from
a Chinese variant of the Indian turnip. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
took a couple of weeks, with the aid of a
physician, for the wag to recover from the
little unpleasantness which the Chinaman
had inflicted upon him.</p>

<h2>THE FRIGHTENED FISHERMAN</h2>


<p>When testing big guns at Sandy
Hook, the officers are often greatly
annoyed by fishing boats that persist
in getting within range of the guns and
in remaining there, entirely regardless of
the work or wishes of the officers of Uncle
Sam.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance that, according
to the law of the country, these ships
have the right of way, and even the officers
of the Government Proving Grounds have
no power to compel a fishing smack to move
out of range.</p>

<p>There was one boat of this kind that persisted
in anchoring daily exactly in the range
of a ten-inch gun that was under test, and
day after day the tests had to be delayed.</p>

<p>One morning, however, there being a haze
or fog floating close down upon the water at
a distance of a couple of miles from the
shore, and the sea looking perfectly clear to
that distance, the officers in charge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
testing of the gun concluded that the range
was clear, and they fired, but the captain of
the fishing boat above referred to happened
to be on his job, just as usual, though concealed
by the fog. He had stretched himself
out in a hammock on deck and was taking
a snooze, when a ten-inch projectile
passed through his boat under him, and
ricocheted on out to sea. He kept out of the
gunner&#8217;s range after that.</p>

<p>Following this incident, one of the officers
conceived the brilliant idea of keeping fishermen
from coming into the line of fire in the
following manner: When a boat was seen
sailing into range he would fire several six-pound
shells, exploding them in the water
along the line of range, and directly in the
path of the oncoming boat. This method
served the purpose admirably. While the
fishermen would calmly cast anchor and occupy
a position directly in range of a gun
being tested, they did not dare to sail directly
into the line of fire of exploding six-pound
shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE COLONEL WAS PROVOKED</h2>


<p>An Army officer tells me the following
story:</p>

<p>One time, while he was on duty at
the Sandy Hook Proving Grounds, they were
testing a gun-shield to see whether or not it
would resist the penetration of a six-inch
shell.</p>

<p>The officer whose duty it was to attend to
the loading and firing of the gun did not always
allow the required time to elapse after
sounding the warning before discharging the
gun, especially when he took it for granted
that no one was in the zone of danger, in
which case he was apt to consider the signal
of warning a mere formality.</p>

<p>Such was his attitude and action on the
occasion to which this story refers: He gave
the signal, and immediately fired. The projectile,
which was expected to penetrate the
shield, went only half through, and stuck
there, when, to the horror of all participants,
especially of the careless officer referred to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the Colonel of Artillery emerged from behind
the shield, unhurt, but madder than a
demon in Dante&#8217;s Inferno.</p>

<p>No more guns were fired without the lapse
of an ample period of warning.</p>

<h2>WHEN THE DARKIES TURNED PALE</h2>


<p>At one of our Government proving
grounds, some years ago, the officers
were testing a new high explosive,
and, as was their custom, they charged a
twelve-inch shell with the material in order
to estimate the power of the explosive by the
fragmentation of the projectile when the
charge was detonated.</p>

<p>They had a bomb-proof chamber prepared
for this purpose. It consisted of a room
about ten feet wide, twelve feet long, and
eight feet high, lined with armorplate. The
projectile was placed on the armored floor
in the middle of the room, and covered
with a few hundred pounds of fine sand. It
was armed with an electrical exploder, which
was set off from another bomb-proof at a
safe distance. After each explosion, the
fragments were sifted from the sand and
counted and weighed.</p>

<p>A twelve-inch shell charged with Maximite
and exploded at Sandy Hook during the tests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
there of that explosive, was broken into ten
thousand fragments. The fragments made
deep dents in the hard face of the armorplate.
The shell that enters into this story
was exploded under similar conditions.</p>

<p>When the officers were ready to explode the
shell, they sounded the usual alarm to give
warning to laboring men on the premises to
seek cover. Now, it so happened that about
a dozen negroes who were engaged in some
pick-and-shovel work had been in the habit
of using this very bomb-proof as a shelter
when a big gun was fired; consequently,
when the warning was sounded, they immediately
rushed for cover within that bomb-proof.</p>

<p>The officer in command was about to close
the switch to explode the projectile, and his
hand was already upon it, but, being an exceedingly
cautious man, he thought he would
take another look to be sure that all was safe,
and, to his amazement, he saw a negro who
had been screening himself behind a pile of
rubbish making a dash for the bomb-proof
containing the projectile, when it was revealed
that the dozen darkies had all huddled
into it for safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>When those darkies found out how close a
call they had had, they turned just as pale
as negroes can turn. Had the projectile
been exploded while they were in the bomb-proof,
they would not only have all been
killed by the blast, but would also have
literally been blown to ribbons.</p>

<h2>THE DOG THAT WAS A REAL MASCOT</h2>


<p>In the long line of trenches that constitutes
the French and British front,
facing the equally long German front,
the soldiers relieve time&#8217;s tedium by numerous
artifices. Many kinds of pets&mdash;dogs,
cats, owls, doves, parrots&mdash;are harbored
for the sake of their company, or as
mascots&mdash;bringers of good luck.</p>

<p>A French soldier had a dog that was a
great favorite in the trenches, for the reason
that he was a famous ratter, and as the
trenches were infested with rats, he was a
most welcome guest.</p>

<p>One day, when the Germans were bombarding
the French position before Verdun
preparatory to a charge, a huge howitzer
shell, penetrating deep into the earth in
front of one of the French trenches, and exploding,
buried half a hundred men&mdash;among
them the owner of the dog.</p>

<p>The dog also was quite buried by the explosion,
but he quickly dug himself out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
then he began an eager search for his master.
Smelling out his location, he dug furiously
with all his might to unearth him.
Fortunately, his master&#8217;s head was near
the surface of the ground, but his arms
and legs were bound tight so that he could
not move, and he was nearly suffocated when
the dog succeeded in digging out his head
and face so that he could breathe.</p>

<p>Happily, relief came soon, and when the
rescuing party arrived, they found the dog
still working with all his strength to uncover
his master.</p>

<p>Pick and spade soon brought the dog&#8217;s
quarry to the surface, who was quite unharmed
except for a few bruises, while the
dog, it was seen, was bleeding at ears, eyes
and mouth from the effect of the explosive
blast.</p>

<h2>WEARY WILLIE&#8217;S DISCOMFITURE</h2>


<p>Some good old English folk whose prosperous
son had made a large amount of
money in the railroad business in
America, were persuaded by their boy to give
up their fine, old-fashioned English country
home for such home life as America could
afford.</p>

<p>The dutiful son had anticipated the wants
and pleasures of his parents, and on a fine
country estate he had built practically a
replica of the old English homestead. There
was the big fireplace and the big, wide chimney,
to be swept by the smutty chimney-sweep.
The chimney was provided with pegs
to climb up and down.</p>

<p>Some time after the good parents were
quartered in their new home, Weary William
the wanderer, a real hobo, walking past the
place late one night, could see enough of it
in the moonlight to recognize its genuine
English aspect; for Weary Willie had, in his
boyhood days, been one of those smut-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
chimney-sweeps in old England, and when he
walked up and peeped through the window
and saw a few embers in the familiar fireplace,
he concluded to go down that chimney
and take a nap in the cosy comfort that the
room provided, and perchance find something
to eat and drink without waking anyone.</p>

<p>Entering the room by way of the chimney,
he did find, all set as though for himself,
edibles and wine&mdash;left-overs from someone&#8217;s
late supper.</p>

<p>After feasting, he took a snooze on the
sofa, intending to take his leave the way he
came at an early hour before the family
was up, but he had drunken more of the
good wine than he ought, and he slept
soundly. He was awakened by voices, which
told him that it was high time and past for
him to make his exit, and he scooted up the
chimney in great haste, but not a whit too
quickly, for by the time he had raised himself
up out of sight, several persons entered
the room. He did not dare continue his
ascent or move for fear of making a noise.
He waited there, breathless, for a more favorable
opportunity to climb out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>It so happened that an ingenious Yankee
neighbor of the English gentlefolk had suggested
a more expeditious way of cleaning
the chimney than by sweeping it out in
the old British fashion. He said that all that
was necessary was to throw several pounds
of black gunpowder into the fire, which, flashing,
would blow the soot out of the chimney.
Of course, the genius had never tried the
experiment himself, but as such geniuses are
usually cocksure, he was so confident of success
that he did not feel the need to make any
preliminary experiments. Therefore, just
as the tramp had mounted above the line of
vision into the chimney, the genius, entering
the room, threw the gunpowder into the fire,
which instantly exploded with a great flash
and smoke, blowing cinders and embers all
over the room and filling it with dense, black,
sulphurous smoke, burning the face and
hands of the genius considerably, and frightening
the elderly people out of their
wits. But what frightened them all still
more, was the appearance of the thoroughly
singed and scared tramp, who fell from
his perch in the chimney, down into the
fireplace, and rolled out into the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
sneezing, coughing and saying things, all at
once.</p>

<p>The terrified tramp was easily secured,
and when the master&#8217;s gold watch&mdash;a gift
from royalty and a family heirloom&mdash;was
found upon his person, the genius was not
only forgiven for his miscalculated experiment,
but also thanked for his good offices.</p>

<h2>LO, THE POOR INDIAN!</h2>


<p>Dave King, editor of the <cite>Morris
County Press</cite>, Morristown, New Jersey,
was reared a lariat man in the
Wild and Woolly, in the days before civilization,
rum and guns had subdued the
Cheyennes, the Comanches and the Sioux to
extinction or to the more uncongenial fate
of enforced good behavior.</p>

<p>In all of Dave&#8217;s hair-ruffling experiences&mdash;corralling
stampeding long-horns, lassoing
and riding a bull-buffalo bare-back, hunting,
with Rex Beach, the great Kadiak bear in
Alaska, whose enormous bulk and Ivan-the-Terrible
disposition would by comparison
make the grizzly of the Rocky Mountains a
gentle companion&mdash;his most intimately interesting,
close-to-nature adventure was when
he was ten years old, and dwelt upon the
upper waters of the Arkansas.</p>

<p>Dave&#8217;s father, a husky pioneer, accompanied
by his ten-year-old son, his brother,
&#8220;Uncle Joe,&#8221; an assortment of dogs, guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and ammunition, embracing a dozen kegs of
gunpowder, had gone there to stake a squatter&#8217;s
claim, hunt buffalo and grow up with
the country.</p>

<p>Timber was scarce, so, after the manner
of the troglodyte, they burrowed out a room
in the side of a hill, which constituted at once
cook-room, dining-room and parlor, and also
museum of rare weapons, dog-kennel and
powder-magazine. The cook-stove was placed
in the middle of the room, and the flue was
run up through the ground for ventilation
and the escape of products of combustion.</p>

<p>One day, Dave&#8217;s father and Uncle Joe
went on a buffalo hunt, much to the disconsolation
of Dave, who wanted to go along.
Toward the end of the afternoon following
the departure of the hunters, Dave built a
roaring fire in the stove to keep himself company,
and incidentally to prepare supper
for himself and the hunters, who were expected
to return before sundown.</p>

<p>His eyes regarded longingly a double-barreled
shotgun hung on the wall. He had
many times been warned by his father to
exercise caution in handling the guns during
his absence, but Dave had the dare-devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
spirit of his parent, with the added impulses
of the small boy, and he took down the shotgun
and fondled it lovingly, examining its
firing mechanism. Then he proceeded to return
it to its hanging, not noticing that he
had left one of the hammers cocked. He did
not know that the gun was loaded, and he
would not have been deterred had he known.
In putting up the weapon he accidentally
touched the trigger of the cocked hammer
and the charge in that barrel exploded, sending
shot and burning wads under the sleeping-bunks,
just missing one of the kegs of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Dave proceeded with his cooking, but soon
he smelled smoke, and looking under the
bunks discovered, to his horror, that a fire
had started. Under the bunks he went,
pawed at the fire with his hands, and smothered
it with his hat, until he thought that he
had extinguished the last spark. Then he
started for a water-hole an eighth of a mile
distant, to get a pail of water, accompanied
by his favorite dog.</p>

<p>When he got out into the open, he saw a
dozen horsemen just coming into view over
a rising ground between him and the sinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
sun. He thought at first that his father was
bringing company home to dinner, and he
waited and watched. But he soon saw by
the feathered and blanketed make-up and
demeanor of the horsemen that they were
savages on the warpath.</p>

<p>Dave was not long getting himself and his
dog out of sight in a badger-hole which he
had, during many days of hard labor, enlarged
for a playhouse.</p>

<p>The Indians were a party of Cheyennes
who had been forcibly located in the Indian
Territory by the Government. On this occasion,
half a thousand of those fierce warriors
decided to go on the warpath and return
to their former hunting grounds in
Wyoming. On their way they burned houses
and slew and scalped everybody that fell in
their path. Among many other outrages
they, for a little diversion, killed and scalped
a young woman school-teacher and forty
pupils. United States troops then rounded
them up and corralled them in Fort Robinson,
Nebraska. One night they made a break
to escape and the soldiers, now out of patience,
killed the whole bunch.</p>

<p>But to return to Dave: When the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
saw the smoke coming out of the top of the
ground, their curiosity was excited, and discovering
that it was a dwelling they rode
round it, red-man fashion, in a constantly
narrowing circle, firing guns and war-whooping.</p>

<p>The dog began to bark and struggle to free
himself to get after those Indians, but Dave
thrust his hand into the animal&#8217;s mouth, and
grasping his lower jaw managed to keep him
from barking. It took all of Dave&#8217;s strength
to hold that dog, but he knew that it meant
life or death, for if the dog should escape
he would betray their hiding-place.</p>

<p>The Indians, finding no sign of life in the
dugout except the barking dogs that Dave
had shut in, came closer and closer. Half a
dozen of them got up on the top of the dugout,
and the others bunched themselves in
close to the entrance, preparatory to rushing
the place.</p>

<p>But Dave had not succeeded in extinguishing
the last spark of the fire that he had
started under the bunks, so, coincidentally
with the Indians arranging themselves about
the cavern, the twelve kegs of gunpowder
went into action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave could not imagine what had happened.
He thought that possibly the Indians
had captured the gunpowder and exploded it
purposely, but he did not dare to emerge
from his hiding.</p>

<p>There was an interval of silence. There
were no more war-whoops, and he concluded
that the Indians had departed. They had,
but not exactly in the manner that Dave
imagined.</p>

<p>The parent and Uncle Joe, returning on
the edge of evening, were dumbfounded at
finding only a great hole in the ground where
the dwelling had been. Dave&#8217;s father wrung
his hands and bemoaned the loss of his boy,
while Uncle Joe consoled him with the usual
I-told-you-so that he ought not to have kept
the gunpowder in the place.</p>

<p>They began a diligent search for any
souvenirs of Dave that might have happened
to return to Mother Earth. After they had
gathered up about a wagon-load of the disintegrated
Indians, Uncle Joe suggested that
they must be on the wrong scent.</p>

<p>At this puzzling juncture, Dave, hearing
the voices of his father and Uncle Joe, cautiously
emerged from his hiding. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
came in sight, Uncle Joe said, &#8220;There&#8217;s
Dave now! There&#8217;s your boy!&#8221; His father
looked blankly at him for a moment. Though
the vision looked like Dave he could not trust
it. He said, &#8220;No, it can&#8217;t be my boy! It
can&#8217;t be my boy!&#8221;</p>

<p class="b2">But it was; and Dave is still with us.</p>
